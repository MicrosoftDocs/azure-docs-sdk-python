summary: The response body contains the status of the specified asynchronous operation,
  indicating whether it has succeeded, is in progress, or has failed. Note that this
  status is distinct from the HTTP status code returned for the Get Operation Status
  operation itself. If the asynchronous operation succeeded, the response body includes
  the HTTP status code for the successful request. If the asynchronous operation failed,
  the response body includes the HTTP status code for the failed request and error
  information regarding the failure.
