    The index is

- description: 'Index is updated asynchronously with respect to a create

    or update operation.

    updated when the collection is idle.'

- description: 'No index is provided.


    Setting IndexingMode to "None" drops the index. Use this if you don''t

    want to maintain the index for a document collection, to save the

    storage cost or improve the write throughput. Your queries will

    degenerate to scans of the entire collection.'
