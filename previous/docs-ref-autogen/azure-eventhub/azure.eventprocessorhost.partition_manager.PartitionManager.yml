  summary: 'Determines and return which lease to steal

    If the number of leases is a multiple of the number of hosts, then the desired

    configuration is that all hosts own the name number of leases, and the

    difference between the "biggest" owner and any other is 0.


    If the number of leases is not a multiple of the number of hosts, then the most

    even configurationpossible is for some hosts to have (self, leases/hosts) leases

    and others to have (self, (self, leases/hosts) + 1). For example, for 16 partitions

    distributed over five hosts, the distribution would be 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, or any of
    the

    possible reorderings.


    In either case, if the difference between this host and the biggest owner is 2
    or more,

    then thesystem is not in the most evenly-distributed configuration, so steal one
    lease

    from the biggest. If there is a tie for biggest, we pick whichever appears first
    in the

    list because it doesn''t really matter which "biggest" is trimmed down.


    Stealing one at a time prevents flapping because it reduces the difference between
    the

    biggest and this host by two at a time. If the starting difference is two or greater,

    then the difference cannot end up below 0. This host may become tied for biggest,
    but it

    cannot become larger than the host that it is stealing from.'
