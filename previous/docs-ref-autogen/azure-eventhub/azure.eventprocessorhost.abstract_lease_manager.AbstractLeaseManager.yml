summary: 'If you wish to have EventProcessorHost store leases somewhere other than
  Azure Storage,

  you can write your own lease manager using this abstract class. The Azure Storage
  managers

  use the same storage for both lease and checkpoints, so both interfaces are implemented
  by

  the same class.You are free to do the same thing if you have  a unified store for
  both

  types of data.'
