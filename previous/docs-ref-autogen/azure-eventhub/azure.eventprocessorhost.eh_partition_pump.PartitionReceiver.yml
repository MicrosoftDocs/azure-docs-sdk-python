  summary: 'This method is called on the thread that the EH client uses to run the
    pump.

    There is one pump per EventHubClient. Since each PartitionPump creates a

    new EventHubClient, using that thread to call OnEvents does no harm. Even if OnEvents

    is slow, the pump will get control back each time OnEvents returns, and be able
    to receive

    a new batch of messages with which to make the next OnEvents call.The pump gains
    nothing

    by running faster than OnEvents.'

  parameters:
  - name: events
