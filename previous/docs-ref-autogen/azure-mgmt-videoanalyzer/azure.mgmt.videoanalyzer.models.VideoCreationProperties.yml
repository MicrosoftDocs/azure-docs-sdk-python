summary: Optional properties to be used in case a new video resource needs to be created
  on the service. These will not take effect if the video already exists.
constructor:
  syntax: 'VideoCreationProperties(*, title: str | None = None, description: str |
    None = None, segment_length: str | None = None, retention_period: str | None =
    None, **kwargs)'
  parameters:
  - name: title
    description: Optional title provided by the user. Value can be up to 256 characters
      long.
    isRequired: true
    types:
    - <xref:str>

      characters long.'

    types:
    - <xref:str>
  - name: segment_length
    description: 'Segment length indicates the length of individual content files

      (segments) which are persisted to storage. Smaller segments provide lower archive
      playback

      latency but generate larger volume of storage transactions. Larger segments
      reduce the amount

      of storage transactions while increasing the archive playback latency. Value
      must be specified

      in ISO8601 duration format (i.e. "PT30S" equals 30 seconds) and can vary between
      30 seconds to

      5 minutes, in 30 seconds increments. Changing this value after the initial call
      to create the

      video resource can lead to errors when uploading content to the archive. Default
      value is 30

      seconds. This property is only allowed for topologies where "kind" is set to
      "live".'
    isRequired: true
    types:
    - <xref:str>
  - name: retention_period
    description: 'Video retention period indicates how long the video is kept in

      storage. Value must be specified in ISO8601 duration format (i.e. "P1D" equals
      1 day) and can

      vary between 1 day to 10 years, in 1 day increments. When absent (null), all
      video content is

      retained indefinitely. This property is only allowed for topologies where "kind"
      is set to

      "live".'
