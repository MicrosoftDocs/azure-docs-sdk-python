summary: 'By default, Storage Analytics will not delete any logging or metrics data.
  Blobs

  will continue to be written until the shared 20TB limit is

  reached. Once the 20TB limit is reached, Storage Analytics will stop writing

  new data and will not resume until free space is available. This 20TB limit

  is independent of the total limit for your storage account.


  There are two ways to delete Storage Analytics data: by manually making deletion

  requests or by setting a data retention policy. Manual requests to delete Storage

  Analytics data are billable, but delete requests resulting from a retention policy

  are not billable.'
