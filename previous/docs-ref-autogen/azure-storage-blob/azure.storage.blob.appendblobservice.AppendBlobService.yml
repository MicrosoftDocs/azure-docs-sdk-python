summary: 'An append blob is comprised of blocks and is optimized for append operations.

  When you modify an append blob, blocks are added to the end of the blob only,

  via the append_block operation. Updating or deleting of existing blocks is not

  supported. Unlike a block blob, an append blob does not expose its block IDs.


  Each block in an append blob can be a different size, up to a maximum of 4 MB,

  and an append blob can include up to 50,000 blocks. The maximum size of an

  append blob is therefore slightly more than 195 GB (4 MB X 50,000 blocks).'
