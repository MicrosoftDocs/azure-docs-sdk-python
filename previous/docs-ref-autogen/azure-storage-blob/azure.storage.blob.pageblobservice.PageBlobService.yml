summary: 'Page blobs are a collection of 512-byte pages optimized for random read
  and

  write operations. To create a page blob, you initialize the page blob and

  specify the maximum size the page blob will grow. To add or update the

  contents of a page blob, you write a page or pages by specifying an offset

  and a range that align to 512-byte page boundaries. A write to a page blob

  can overwrite just one page, some pages, or up to 4 MB of the page blob.

  Writes to page blobs happen in-place and are immediately committed to the

  blob. The maximum size for a page blob is 8 TB.
