summary: The Anomaly Detector API detects anomalies automatically in time series data.
  It supports two kinds of mode, one is for stateless using, another is for stateful
  using. In stateless mode, there are three functionalities. Entire Detect is for
  detecting the whole series with model trained by the time series, Last Detect is
  detecting last point with model trained by points before. ChangePoint Detect is
  for detecting trend changes in time series. In stateful mode, user can store time
  series, the stored time series will be used for detection anomalies. Under this
  mode, user can still use the above three functionalities by only giving a time range
  without preparing time series in client side. Besides the above three functionalities,
  stateful model also provide group based detection and labeling service. By leveraging
  labeling service user can provide labels for each detection result, these labels
  will be used for retuning or regenerating detection models. Inconsistency detection
  is a kind of group based detection, this detection will find inconsistency ones
  in a set of time series. By using anomaly detector service, business customers can
  discover incidents and establish a logic flow for root cause analysis.
