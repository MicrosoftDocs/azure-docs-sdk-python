# Microsoft Azure SDK for Python

 We’re retiring the Azure Video Analyzer preview service; you're advised to transition your applications off of Video Analyzer by 01 December 2022. This SDK is no longer maintained and won’t work after the service is retired. To learn how to transition off, please refer to: [Transition from Azure Video Analyzer - Azure Video Analyzer | Microsoft Docs](/azure/azure-video-analyzer/video-analyzer-docs/transition-from-video-analyzer)
