# Microsoft Azure SDK for Python

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Face service access is limited based on eligibility and usage criteria in order to support our Responsible AI principles. Face service is only available to Microsoft managed customers and partners. Use the [Face Recognition intake form](https://aka.ms/facerecognition) to apply for access. For more information, see the [Face limited access](/legal/cognitive-services/computer-vision/limited-access-identity?context=%2Fazure%2Fcognitive-services%2Fcomputer-vision%2Fcontext%2Fcontext) page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft will be retiring facial recognition capabilities that can be used to try to infer emotional states and identity attributes which, if misused, can subject people to stereotyping, discrimination or unfair denial of services. These include capabilities that predict emotion, gender, age, smile, facial hair, hair and makeup. Existing customers have until June 30, 2023 to discontinue use of these capabilities before they are retired. Read more about this decision in the [announcement post](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/responsible-ai-investments-and-safeguards-for-facial-recognition/).

This is the Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services Face Client Library.
