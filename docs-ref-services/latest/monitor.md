# Azure Monitor libraries for Python

## Overview

Monitoring provides data to ensure that your application stays up and running in a healthy state. It also helps you to stave off potential problems or troubleshoot past ones. In addition, you can use monitoring data to gain deep insights about your application. That knowledge can help you to improve application performance or maintainability, or automate actions that would otherwise require manual intervention.

To learn more about Azure Monitor, see [Azure Monitor overview](/azure/azure-monitor/overview).
