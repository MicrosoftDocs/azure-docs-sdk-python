# Azure Cognitive Services modules for Python

Add image and face recognition, language analysis, and search to your Python apps, websites, and tools using the Azure Cognitive Services modules for Python.

## Vision modules

### Computer Vision 

Returns information about visual content found in an image:

- Use tagging, descriptions, and domain-specific models to identify content and label it with confidence.
- Apply adult/racy settings to enable automated restriction of adult content.
- Identify image types and color schemes in pictures.

[Try Computer Vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/) for free in your browser.

Get the Python module with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/quickstart/):

```python
pip install azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision
```
