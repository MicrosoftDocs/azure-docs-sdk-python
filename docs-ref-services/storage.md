# Azure Storage libraries for Python

## Overview
- Read and write objects and files from [Azure Blob storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-python-how-to-use-blob-storage)
- Send and receive messages between cloud-connected applications with [Azure Queue storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/storage-python-how-to-use-queue-storage)
- Read and write large structured data with [Azure Table storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/storage-python-how-to-use-table-storage) 
- Share storage between apps with [Azure File storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/storage-python-how-to-use-file-storage)

Create, update, and manage Azure Storage accounts and query and regenerate access keys from your Python code with the management libraries.

## Install the libraries

### Client

```bash
pip install azure-storage
```

### Management

```bash
pip install azure-mgmt-storage
```

## Example
```python
storage_client = CloudStorageAccount(storage_account_name, storage_key)
blob_service = storage_client.create_block_blob_service()

blob_service.create_container(
    'mycontainername',
    public_access=PublicAccess.Blob
)

blob_service.create_blob_from_bytes(
    'mycontainername',
    'myblobname',
    b'<center><h1>Hello World!</h1></center>',
    content_settings=ContentSettings('text/html')
)

print(blob_service.make_blob_url('mycontainername', 'myblobname'))
```
