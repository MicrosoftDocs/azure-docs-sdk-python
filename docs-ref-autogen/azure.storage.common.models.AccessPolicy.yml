  summary: 'Access Policy class used by the set and get acl methods in each service.


    A stored access policy can specify the start time, expiry time, and

    permissions for the Shared Access Signatures with which it''s associated.

    Depending on how you want to control access to your resource, you can

    specify all of these parameters within the stored access policy, and omit

    them from the URL for the Shared Access Signature. Doing so permits you to

    modify the associated signature''s behavior at any time, as well as to revoke

    it. Or you can specify one or more of the access policy parameters within

    the stored access policy, and the others on the URL. Finally, you can

    specify all of the parameters on the URL. In this case, you can use the

    stored access policy to revoke the signature, but not to modify its behavior.


    Together the Shared Access Signature and the stored access policy must

    include all fields required to authenticate the signature. If any required

    fields are missing, the request will fail. Likewise, if a field is specified

    both in the Shared Access Signature URL and in the stored access policy, the

    request will fail with status code 400 (Bad Request).
