methods:
- uid: azure.search.documents.IndexDocumentsBatch.add_delete_actions
  name: add_delete_actions
  summary: 'Add documents to delete to the Azure search index.


    Delete removes the specified document from the index. Any field you

    specify in a delete operation, other than the key field, will be

    ignored. If you want to remove an individual field from a document, use

    *merge_documents* instead and set the field explicitly to None.


    Delete operations are idempotent. That is, even if a document key does

    not exist in the index, attempting a delete operation with that key will

    result in a 200 status code.'
