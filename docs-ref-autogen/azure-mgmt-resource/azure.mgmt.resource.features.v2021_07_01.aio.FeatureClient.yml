summary: Azure Feature Exposure Control (AFEC) provides a mechanism for the resource
  providers to control feature exposure to users. Resource providers typically use
  this mechanism to provide public/private preview for new features prior to making
  them generally available. Users need to explicitly register for AFEC features to
  get access to such functionality.
