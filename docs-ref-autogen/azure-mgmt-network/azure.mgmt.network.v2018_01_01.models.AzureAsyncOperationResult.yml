  summary: The response body contains the status of the specified asynchronous operation,
    indicating whether it has succeeded, is in progress, or has failed. Note that
    this status is distinct from the HTTP status code returned for the Get Operation
    Status operation itself. If the asynchronous operation succeeded, the response
    body includes the HTTP status code for the successful request. If the asynchronous
    operation failed, the response body includes the HTTP status code for the failed
    request and error information regarding the failure.
