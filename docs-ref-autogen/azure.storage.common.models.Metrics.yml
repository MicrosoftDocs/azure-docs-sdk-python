  summary: 'Metrics include aggregated transaction statistics and capacity data about
    requests

    to a storage service. Transactions are reported at both the API operation level

    as well as at the storage service level, and capacity is reported at the storage

    service level. Metrics data can be used to analyze storage service usage, diagnose

    issues with requests made against the storage service, and to improve the

    performance of applications that use a service.
