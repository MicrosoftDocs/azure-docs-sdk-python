        \ Bing APIs and in turn enables higher\nclick-through rates for the API consumer.\
        \ IMPORTANT: Although\noptional, you should consider this header required.\
        \ Persisting the\nclient ID across multiple requests for the same end user\

        to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern latitudes and positive

        the client''s location, in degrees. The longitude must be greater than

        or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to +180.0. Negative values

        indicate western longitudes and positive values indicate eastern

        longitudes. re (required): The radius, in meters, which specifies the

        horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the value returned by the

        device''s location service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi,

        380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup.

        ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the

        location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January

        1, 1970.) head (optional): The client''s relative heading or direction

        of travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through

        360, counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only

        if the sp key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity

        (speed), in meters per second, that the client device is traveling.

        alt (optional): The altitude of the client device, in meters. are

        (optional): The radius, in meters, that specifies the vertical

        accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key only if you specify the

        alt key. Although many of the keys are optional, the more information

        that you provide, the more accurate the location results are. Although

        optional, you are encouraged to always specify the user''s geographical

        location. Providing the location is especially important if the

        client''s IP address does not accurately reflect the user''s physical

        location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For optimal results,

        you should include this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP header, but

        at a minimum, you should include this header.'
