        the possible filter values. Off: May return images with adult content.

        If the request is through the Image Search API, the response includes

        thumbnail images that are clear (non-fuzzy). However, if the request

        is through the Web Search API, the response includes thumbnail images

        that are pixelated (fuzzy). Moderate: If the request is through the

        Image Search API, the response doesn''t include images with adult

        content. If the request is through the Web Search API, the response

        may include images with adult content (the thumbnail images are

        pixelated (fuzzy)). Strict: Do not return images with adult content.

        The default is Moderate. If the request comes from a market that

        Bing''s adult policy requires that safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing

        ignores the safeSearch value and uses Strict. If you use the site:

        query operator, there is the chance that the response may contain

        adult content regardless of what the safeSearch query parameter is set

        to. Use site: only if you are aware of the content on the site and

        your scenario supports the possibility of adult content. Possible
