        nodes, the Batch service installs the certificates to the specified

        are stored in a directory inside the task working directory and an

        environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to

        query for this location. For certificates with visibility of ''remoteUser'',

        a ''certs'' directory is created in the user''s home directory (e.g.,

        /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that directory.
