  You probably want to use the sub-classes and not this class directly. Known

  sub-classes are: AKS, AmlCompute, ComputeInstance, DataFactory, DataLakeAnalytics,
  Databricks, HDInsight, VirtualMachine.


  Variables are only populated by the server, and will be ignored when sending a request.


  All required parameters must be populated in order to send to Azure.'
