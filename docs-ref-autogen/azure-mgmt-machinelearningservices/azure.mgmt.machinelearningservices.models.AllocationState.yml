summary: 'Allocation state of the compute. Possible values are: steady - Indicates
  that the compute is

  not resizing. There are no changes to the number of compute nodes in the compute

  on the

  compute to change the number of compute nodes. resizing - Indicates that the compute
  is

  resizing; that is, compute nodes are being added to or removed from the compute.'
