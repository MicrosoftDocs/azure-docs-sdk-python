summary: 'Allocation state of the compute. Possible values are: steady - Indicates
  that the compute is

  not resizing. There are no changes to the number of compute nodes in the compute
  in progress. A

  compute enters this state when it is created and when no operations are being performed
  on the

  compute to change the number of compute nodes. resizing - Indicates that the compute
  is

  resizing; that is, compute nodes are being added to or removed from the compute.'
