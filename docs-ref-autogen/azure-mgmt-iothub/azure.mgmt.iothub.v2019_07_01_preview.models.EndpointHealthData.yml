    description: 'Health statuses have following meanings. The ''healthy'' status
      shows that

      the endpoint is accepting messages as expected. The ''unhealthy'' status shows
      that the endpoint

      is not accepting messages as expected and IoT Hub is retrying to send data to
      this endpoint.

      The status of an unhealthy endpoint will be updated to healthy when IoT Hub
      has established an

      eventually consistent state of health. The ''dead'' status shows that the endpoint
      is not

      accepting messages, after IoT Hub retried sending messages for the retrial period.
      See IoT Hub

      metrics to identify errors and monitor issues with endpoints. The ''unknown''
      status shows that

      the IoT Hub has not established a connection with the endpoint. No messages
      have been delivered

      to or rejected from this endpoint. Possible values include: "unknown", "healthy",
      "unhealthy",

      "dead".'
