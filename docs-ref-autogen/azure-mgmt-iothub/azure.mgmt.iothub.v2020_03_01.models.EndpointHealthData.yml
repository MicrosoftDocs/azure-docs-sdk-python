- description: 'Health statuses have following meanings. The ''healthy'' status shows
    that

    the endpoint is accepting messages as expected. The ''unhealthy'' status shows
    that the endpoint

    is not accepting messages as expected and IoT Hub is retrying to send data to
    this endpoint.

    The status of an unhealthy endpoint will be updated to healthy when IoT Hub has
    established an

    eventually consistent state of health. The ''dead'' status shows that the endpoint
    is not

    accepting messages, after IoT Hub retried sending messages for the retrial period.
    See IoT Hub

    metrics to identify errors and monitor issues with endpoints. The ''unknown''
    status shows that

    the IoT Hub has not established a connection with the endpoint. No messages have
    been delivered

    to or rejected from this endpoint. Possible values include: "unknown", "healthy",
    "unhealthy",

    "dead".'
