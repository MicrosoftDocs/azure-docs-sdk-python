  summary: The health data for an endpoint.
  syntax:
    content: 'EndpointHealthData(*, endpoint_id: str = None, health_status=None, **kwargs)
      -> None'
    parameters:
    - description: Id of the endpoint
      id: endpoint_id
      type:
      - str
    - description: 'Health statuses have following meanings. The

        ''healthy'' status shows that the endpoint is accepting messages as

        expected. The ''unhealthy'' status shows that the endpoint is not accepting

        messages as expected and IoT Hub is retrying to send data to this

        endpoint. The status of an unhealthy endpoint will be updated to healthy

        when IoT Hub has established an eventually consistent state of health. The

        ''dead'' status shows that the endpoint is not accepting messages, after IoT

        Hub retried sending messages for the retrial period. See IoT Hub metrics

        to identify errors and monitor issues with endpoints. The ''unknown'' status

        shows that the IoT Hub has not established a connection with the endpoint.

        No messages have been delivered to or rejected from this endpoint.

        Possible values include: ''unknown'', ''healthy'', ''unhealthy'', ''dead'''
