      that the endpoint is accepting messages as expected. The ''unhealthy'' status
      shows that the

      endpoint is not accepting messages as expected and IoT Hub is retrying to send
      data to this

      endpoint. The status of an unhealthy endpoint will be updated to healthy when
      IoT Hub has

      established an eventually consistent state of health. The ''dead'' status shows
      that the endpoint

      is not accepting messages, after IoT Hub retried sending messages for the retrial
      period. See

      IoT Hub metrics to identify errors and monitor issues with endpoints. The ''unknown''
      status

      shows that the IoT Hub has not established a connection with the endpoint. No
      messages have

      been delivered to or rejected from this endpoint. Known values are: "unknown",

      "degraded", "unhealthy", and "dead".'
