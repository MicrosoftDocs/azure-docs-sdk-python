        For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4

        times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0,

        the Batch service does not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is

        -1, the Batch service retries the task without limit.

        task fails on a compute node, the Batch service retries the start task up

        to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has still not

        completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the

        compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This condition

        can be detected via the node state and failure info details. If false, the

        Batch service will not wait for the start task to complete. In this case,

        other tasks can start executing on the compute node while the start task

        is still running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks will

        continue to be scheduled on the node. The default is false.
