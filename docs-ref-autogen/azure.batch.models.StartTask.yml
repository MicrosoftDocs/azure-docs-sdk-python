  summary: 'A task which is run when a compute node joins a pool in the Azure Batch

    service, or when the compute node is rebooted or reimaged.


    Batch will retry tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a compute

    node. Examples of recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when

    an unhealthy compute node is rebooted or a compute node disappeared due to

    host failure. Retries due to recovery operations are independent of and are

    not counted against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount is

    0, an internal retry due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of

    this, all tasks should be idempotent. This means tasks need to tolerate

    being interrupted and restarted without causing any corruption or duplicate

    data. The best practice for long running tasks is to use some form of

    checkpointing.

        For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4

        times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0,

        the Batch service does not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is

        -1, the Batch service retries the task without limit.

        to its maximum retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the task has still not

        completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the

        compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This condition

        can be detected via the node state and failure info details. If false, the

        Batch service will not wait for the start task to complete. In this case,

        other tasks can start executing on the compute node while the start task

        is still running; and even if the start task fails, new tasks will

        continue to be scheduled on the node. The default is false.
