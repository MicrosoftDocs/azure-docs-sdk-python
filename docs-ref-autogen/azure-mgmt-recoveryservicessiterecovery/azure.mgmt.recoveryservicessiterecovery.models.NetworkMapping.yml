summary: 'Network Mapping model. Ideally it should have been possible to inherit this
  class from prev

  version in InheritedModels as long as there is no difference in structure or method
  signature.

  Since there were no base Models for certain fields and methods viz NetworkMappingProperties
  and

  Load with required return type, the class has been introduced in its entirety with
  references

  to base models to facilitate extensions in subsequent versions.
