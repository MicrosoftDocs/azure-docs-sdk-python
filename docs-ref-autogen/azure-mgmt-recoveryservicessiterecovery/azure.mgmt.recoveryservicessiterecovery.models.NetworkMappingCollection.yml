summary: 'List of network mappings. As with NetworkMapping, it should be possible
  to reuse a prev version

  of this class. It doesn''t seem likely this class could be anything more than a
  slightly bespoke

  collection of NetworkMapping. Hence it makes sense to override Load with Base.NetworkMapping

  instead of existing CurrentVersion.NetworkMapping.'
