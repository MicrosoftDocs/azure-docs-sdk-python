  - name: upper_margin
    description: 'Required. Upper margin of the latest point.

      UpperMargin is used to calculate upperBoundary, which equals to

      expectedValue + (100 - marginScale)*upperMargin. If the value of latest

      point is between upperBoundary and lowerBoundary, it should be treated as

      normal value. By adjusting marginScale value, anomaly status of latest

      point can be changed.'

    description: 'Required. Anomaly status of the latest point, true

      means the latest point is an anomaly either in negative direction or
