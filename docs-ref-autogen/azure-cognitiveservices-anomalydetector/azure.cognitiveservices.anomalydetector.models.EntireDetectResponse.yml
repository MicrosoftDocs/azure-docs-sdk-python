  All required parameters must be populated in order to send to Azure.'
constructor:
  syntax: 'EntireDetectResponse(*, period: int, expected_values, upper_margins, lower_margins,
    is_anomaly, is_negative_anomaly, is_positive_anomaly, **kwargs)'
  parameters:
  - name: period
    description: 'Required. Frequency extracted from the series, zero means

      no recurrent pattern has been found.'
    isRequired: true
    types:
    - <xref:int>
  - name: expected_values
    description: 'Required. ExpectedValues contain expected value

      for each input point. The index of the array is consistent with the input

      series.'
    isRequired: true
    types:
    - <xref:list>[<xref:float>]
  - name: upper_margins
    description: 'Required. UpperMargins contain upper margin of each

      input point. UpperMargin is used to calculate upperBoundary, which equals

      to expectedValue + (100 - marginScale)*upperMargin. Anomalies in response

      can be filtered by upperBoundary and lowerBoundary. By adjusting

      marginScale value, less significant anomalies can be filtered in client

      side. The index of the array is consistent with the input series.'
    isRequired: true
    types:
    - <xref:list>[<xref:float>]
  - name: lower_margins
    description: 'Required. LowerMargins contain lower margin of each

      input point. LowerMargin is used to calculate lowerBoundary, which equals

      to expectedValue - (100 - marginScale)*lowerMargin. Points between the

      boundary can be marked as normal ones in client side. The index of the

      array is consistent with the input series.'
    isRequired: true
    types:
    - <xref:list>[<xref:float>]
  - name: is_anomaly
    description: 'Required. IsAnomaly contains anomaly properties for

      each input point. True means an anomaly either negative or positive has

      been detected. The index of the array is consistent with the input series.'
    isRequired: true
    types:
    - <xref:list>[<xref:bool>]
  - name: is_negative_anomaly
    description: 'Required. IsNegativeAnomaly contains anomaly

      status in negative direction for each input point. True means a negative

      anomaly has been detected. A negative anomaly means the point is detected

      as an anomaly and its real value is smaller than the expected one. The

      index of the array is consistent with the input series.'
    isRequired: true
    types:
    - <xref:list>[<xref:bool>]
  - name: is_positive_anomaly
    description: 'Required. IsPositiveAnomaly contain anomaly

      status in positive direction for each input point. True means a positive

      anomaly has been detected. A positive anomaly means the point is detected

      as an anomaly and its real value is larger than the expected one. The

      index of the array is consistent with the input series.'
