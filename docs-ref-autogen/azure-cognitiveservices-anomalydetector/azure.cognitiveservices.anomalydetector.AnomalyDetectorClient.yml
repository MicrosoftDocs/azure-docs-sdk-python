  summary: The Anomaly Detector API detects anomalies automatically in time series
    data. It supports two kinds of mode, one is for stateless using, another is for
    stateful using. In stateless mode, there are three functionalities. Entire Detect
    is for detecting the whole series with model trained by the time series, Last
    Detect is detecting last point with model trained by points before. ChangePoint
    Detect is for detecting trend changes in time series. In stateful mode, user can
    store time series, the stored time series will be used for detection anomalies.
    Under this mode, user can still use the above three functionalities by only giving
    a time range without preparing time series in client side. Besides the above three
    functionalities, stateful model also provide group based detection and labeling
    service. By leveraging labeling service user can provide labels for each detection
    result, these labels will be used for retuning or regenerating detection models.
    Inconsistency detection is a kind of group based detection, this detection will
    find inconsistency ones in a set of time series. By using anomaly detector service,
    business customers can discover incidents and establish a logic flow for root
    cause analysis.
