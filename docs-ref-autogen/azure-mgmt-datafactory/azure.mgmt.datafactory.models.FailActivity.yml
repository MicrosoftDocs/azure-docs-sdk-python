summary: 'This activity will fail within its own scope and output a custom error message

  The error message and code can provided either as a string literal or as an expression

  be evaluated to a string at runtime. The activity scope can be the whole pipeline
  or a control

  activity (e.g. foreach, switch, until), if the fail activity is contained in it.
