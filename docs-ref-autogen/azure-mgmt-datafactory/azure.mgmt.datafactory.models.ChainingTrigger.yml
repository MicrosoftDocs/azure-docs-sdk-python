  summary: 'Trigger that allows the referenced pipeline to depend on other pipeline

    runs based on runDimension Name/Value pairs. Upstream pipelines should

    declare the same runDimension Name and their runs should have the values

    for those runDimensions. The referenced pipeline run would be triggered if

    the values for the runDimension match for all upstream pipeline runs.


    Variables are only populated by the server, and will be ignored when

    sending a request.
