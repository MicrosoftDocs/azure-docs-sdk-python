  summary: 'A specification for uploading files from an Azure Batch node to another

    location after the Batch service has finished executing the task process.

  syntax:
    content: OutputFile(file_pattern, destination, upload_options)
    parameters:
    - description: 'A pattern indicating which file(s) to upload. Both

        relative and absolute paths are supported. Relative paths are relative to

        the task working directory. The following wildcards are supported: *

        matches 0 or more characters (for example pattern abc* would match abc or

        abcdef), ** matches any directory, ? matches any single character, [abc]

        matches one character in the brackets, and [a-c] matches one character in

        the range. Brackets can include a negation to match any character not

        specified (for example [!abc] matches any character but a, b, or c). If a

        file name starts with "." it is ignored by default but may be matched by

        specifying it explicitly (for example *.gif will not match .a.gif, but

        .*.gif will). A simple example: >>**<<*.txt matches any file that does not

        start in ''.'' and ends with .txt in the task working directory or any

        subdirectory. If the filename contains a wildcard character it can be

        escaped using brackets (for example abc[*] would match a file named abc*).

        Note that both and / are treated as directory separators on Windows,

        but only / is on Linux. Environment variables (%var% on Windows or $var on

        Linux) are expanded prior to the pattern being applied.
