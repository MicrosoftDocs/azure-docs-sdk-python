    after the Batch service has finished executing the task process.'
  syntax:
    content: OutputFile(self, file_pattern, destination, upload_options)
    parameters:
    - description: A pattern indicating which file(s) to upload. Both relative and
        absolute paths are supported. Relative paths are relative to the task working
        directory. For wildcards, use * to match any character and ** to match any
        directory. For example, >>**<<*.txt matches any file ending in .txt in the
        task working directory or any subdirectory. Note that and / are treated interchangeably
        and mapped to the correct directory separator on the compute node operating
        system.
