        compute nodes, the Batch service installs the certificates to the

        specified certificate store and location. For Linux compute nodes, the

        certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory

        and an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the

        task to query for this location. For certificates with visibility of

        ''remoteUser'', a ''certs'' directory is created in the user''s home directory

        (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that

        directory.
