  Since requests team recommends to use one session per requests, you should

  not consider this class as thread-safe, since it will use one Session

  per instance.


  In this simple implementation:

  - You provide the configured session if you want to, or a basic session is created.

  - All kwargs received by "send" are sent to session.request directly'
constructor:
  syntax: 'BasicRequestsHTTPSender(session: Optional[requests.sessions.Session] =
    None)'

- uid: msrest.universal_http.requests.BasicRequestsHTTPSender.close
  name: close
  signature: close()
- uid: msrest.universal_http.requests.BasicRequestsHTTPSender.send
  name: send
  summary: 'Send request object according to configuration.


    Allowed kwargs are:

    - session : will override the driver session and use yours. Should NOT be done
    unless really required.

    - anything else is sent straight to requests.'

  - name: request
