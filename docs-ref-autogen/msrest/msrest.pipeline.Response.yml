  summary: 'A pipeline response object.


    The Response interface exposes an HTTP response object as it returns through the
    pipeline of Policy objects.

    This ensures that Policy objects have access to the HTTP response.


    This also have a "context" dictionnary where policy can put additional fields.

    Policy SHOULD update the "context" dictionary with additional post-processed field
    if they create them.

    However, nothing prevents a policy to actually sub-class this class a return it
    instead of the initial instance.'
