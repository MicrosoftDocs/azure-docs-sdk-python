        \ Bing APIs and in turn enables higher\nclick-through rates for the API consumer.\
        \ IMPORTANT: Although\noptional, you should consider this header required.\
        \ Persisting the\nclient ID across multiple requests for the same end user\

        or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to +180.0. Negative values

        indicate western longitudes and positive values indicate eastern

        longitudes. re (required): The radius, in meters, which specifies the

        horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the value returned by the

        device''s location service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi,

        380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup.

        ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the

        location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January

        1, 1970.) head (optional): The client''s relative heading or direction

        of travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through

        360, counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only

        if the sp key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity

        alt (optional): The altitude of the client device, in meters. are

        (optional): The radius, in meters, that specifies the vertical

        accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key only if you specify the
