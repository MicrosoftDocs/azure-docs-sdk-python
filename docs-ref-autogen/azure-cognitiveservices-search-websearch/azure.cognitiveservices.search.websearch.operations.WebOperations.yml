      This header and the setLang query parameter are mutually exclusive; do

      not specify both. If you set this header, you must also specify the cc

      query parameter. Bing will use the first supported language it finds

      from the list, and combine that language with the cc parameter value

      to determine the market to return results for. If the list does not

      include a supported language, Bing will find the closest language and

      market that supports the request, and may use an aggregated or default

      market for the results instead of a specified one. You should use this

  - name: client_id
    description: 'Bing uses this header to provide users with

      consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new

      features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for

      assigning traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same

      client ID for a user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign

      the user to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple

      conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience. For

      example, if the second request has a different flight assignment than

      the first, the experience may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use the

      client ID to tailor web results to that client ID''s search history,

      providing a richer experience for the user. Bing also uses this header

      to help improve result rankings by analyzing the activity generated by

      a client ID. The relevance improvements help with better quality of

      results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher

      click-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although

      optional, you should consider this header required. Persisting the

      client ID across multiple requests for the same end user and device

      combination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a consistent user

      experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better quality of

      results from the Bing APIs. Each user that uses your application on

      the device must have a unique, Bing generated client ID. If you do not

      include this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns

      it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you

      should NOT include this header in a request is the first time the user

      uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API

      request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the

      client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP

      cookie to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a

      session cookie. For other apps such as mobile apps, use the device''s

      persistent storage to persist the ID. The next time the user uses your

      app on that device, get the client ID that you persisted. Bing

      responses may or may not include this header. If the response includes

      this header, capture the client ID and use it for all subsequent Bing

      requests for the user on that device. If you include the

      X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.'

      optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header and the

      X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for example,

      by changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address results in

      the location not being anywhere near the device''s actual location,

      following are the keys that you use to specify the user''s location.

      lat (required): The latitude of the client''s location, in degrees. The

      latitude must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal

      to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern latitudes and positive

      values indicate northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of

      the client''s location, in degrees. The longitude must be greater than

      or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to +180.0. Negative values

      indicate western longitudes and positive values indicate eastern

      longitudes. re (required): The radius, in meters, which specifies the

      horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the value returned by the

      device''s location service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi,

      380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup.

      ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the

      location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January

      1, 1970.) head (optional): The client''s relative heading or direction

      of travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through

      360, counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only

      if the sp key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity

      (speed), in meters per second, that the client device is traveling.

      alt (optional): The altitude of the client device, in meters. are

      (optional): The radius, in meters, that specifies the vertical

      accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key only if you specify the

      alt key. Although many of the keys are optional, the more information

      that you provide, the more accurate the location results are. Although

      optional, you are encouraged to always specify the user''s geographical

      location. Providing the location is especially important if the

      client''s IP address does not accurately reflect the user''s physical

      location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For optimal results,

      you should include this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP header, but
