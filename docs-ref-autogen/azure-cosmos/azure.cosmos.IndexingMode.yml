- description: 'Index is updated asynchronously with respect to a create or update

    operation. Not supported for new containers since June/2020.


    With lazy indexing, queries are eventually consistent. The index is

    updated when the collection is idle.'

- description: 'No index is provided.


    Setting IndexingMode to "None" drops the index. Use this if you don''t

    want to maintain the index for a document collection, to save the

    storage cost or improve the write throughput. Your queries will

    degenerate to scans of the entire collection.'
