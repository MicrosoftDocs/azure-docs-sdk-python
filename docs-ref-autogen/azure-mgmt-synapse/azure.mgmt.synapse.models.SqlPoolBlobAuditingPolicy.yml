    description: 'Specifies the Actions-Groups and Actions to audit.


      The recommended set of action groups to use is the following combination - this
      will audit all

      the queries and stored procedures executed against the database, as well as
      successful and

      failed logins:


      BATCH_COMPLETED_GROUP,

      SUCCESSFUL_DATABASE_AUTHENTICATION_GROUP,

      FAILED_DATABASE_AUTHENTICATION_GROUP.


      This above combination is also the set that is configured by default when enabling
      auditing

      from the Azure portal.


      The supported action groups to audit are (note: choose only specific groups
      that cover your

      auditing needs. Using unnecessary groups could lead to very large quantities
      of audit records):


      APPLICATION_ROLE_CHANGE_PASSWORD_GROUP

      BACKUP_RESTORE_GROUP

      DATABASE_LOGOUT_GROUP

      DATABASE_OBJECT_CHANGE_GROUP

      DATABASE_OBJECT_OWNERSHIP_CHANGE_GROUP

      DATABASE_OBJECT_PERMISSION_CHANGE_GROUP

      DATABASE_OPERATION_GROUP

      DATABASE_PERMISSION_CHANGE_GROUP

      DATABASE_PRINCIPAL_CHANGE_GROUP

      DATABASE_PRINCIPAL_IMPERSONATION_GROUP

      DATABASE_ROLE_MEMBER_CHANGE_GROUP

      FAILED_DATABASE_AUTHENTICATION_GROUP

      SCHEMA_OBJECT_ACCESS_GROUP

      SCHEMA_OBJECT_CHANGE_GROUP

      SCHEMA_OBJECT_OWNERSHIP_CHANGE_GROUP

      SCHEMA_OBJECT_PERMISSION_CHANGE_GROUP

      SUCCESSFUL_DATABASE_AUTHENTICATION_GROUP

      USER_CHANGE_PASSWORD_GROUP

      BATCH_STARTED_GROUP

      BATCH_COMPLETED_GROUP


      These are groups that cover all sql statements and stored procedures executed
      against the

      database, and should not be used in combination with other groups as this will
      result in

      duplicate audit logs.


      For more information, see [Database-Level Audit Action Groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/auditing/sql-server-audit-action-groups-and-actions#database-level-audit-action-groups).


      For Database auditing policy, specific Actions can also be specified (note that
      Actions cannot

      be specified for Server auditing policy). The supported actions to audit are:

      SELECT

      UPDATE

      INSERT

      DELETE

      EXECUTE

      RECEIVE

      REFERENCES


      The general form for defining an action to be audited is:

      {action} ON {object} BY {principal}


      Note that `<object>` in the above format can refer to an object like a table,
      view, or

      stored procedure, or an entire database or schema. For the latter cases, the
      forms

      DATABASE::{db_name} and SCHEMA::{schema_name} are used, respectively.


      For example:

      SELECT on dbo.myTable by public

      SELECT on DATABASE::myDatabase by public

      SELECT on SCHEMA::mySchema by public


      For more information, see [Database-Level Audit Actions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/auditing/sql-server-audit-action-groups-and-actions#database-level-audit-actions).'

      When using REST API to configure auditing, Diagnostic Settings with ''SQLSecurityAuditEvents''

      diagnostic logs category on the database should be also created.

      Note that for server level audit you should use the ''master'' database as {databaseName}.
