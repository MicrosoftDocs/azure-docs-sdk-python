  disables the

  policy, Unlocked state allows increase and decrease of immutability retention time
  and also

  allows toggling allowProtectedAppendWrites property, Locked state only allows the
  increase of

  the immutability retention time. A policy can only be created in a Disabled or Unlocked
  state

  and can be toggled between the two states. Only a policy in an Unlocked state can
  transition to

  a Locked state which cannot be reverted.'
