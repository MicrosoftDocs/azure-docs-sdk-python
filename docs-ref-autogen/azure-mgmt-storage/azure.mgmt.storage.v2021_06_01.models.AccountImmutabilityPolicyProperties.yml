    description: 'The ImmutabilityPolicy state defines the mode of the policy. Disabled
      state

      disables the policy, Unlocked state allows increase and decrease of immutability
      retention time

      and also allows toggling allowProtectedAppendWrites property, Locked state only
      allows the

      increase of the immutability retention time. A policy can only be created in
      a Disabled or

      Unlocked state and can be toggled between the two states. Only a policy in an
      Unlocked state

      can transition to a Locked state which cannot be reverted. Possible values include:
      "Unlocked",

      "Locked", "Disabled".'
