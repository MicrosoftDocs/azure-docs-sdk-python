  summary: 'A Job Preparation task to run before any tasks of the job on any given

    compute node.


    You can use Job Preparation to prepare a compute node to run tasks for the

    job. Activities commonly performed in Job Preparation include: Downloading

    common resource files used by all the tasks in the job. The Job Preparation

    task can download these common resource files to the shared location on the

    compute node. (AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIRshared), or starting a local service

    on the compute node so that all tasks of that job can communicate with it.

    If the Job Preparation task fails (that is, exhausts its retry count before

    exiting with exit code 0), Batch will not run tasks of this job on the

    compute node. The node remains ineligible to run tasks of this job until it

    is reimaged. The node remains active and can be used for other jobs. The

    Job Preparation task can run multiple times on the same compute node.

    Therefore, you should write the Job Preparation task to handle

    re-execution. If the compute node is rebooted, the Job Preparation task is

    run again on the node before scheduling any other task of the job, if

    rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess is true or if the Job Preparation task did

    not previously complete. If the compute node is reimaged, the Job

    Preparation task is run again before scheduling any task of the job.
