        ''degraded'': The Search service is degraded. This can occur when the

        underlying search units are not healthy. The Search service is most likely

        operational, but performance might be slow and some requests might be

        dropped. ''disabled'': The Search service is disabled. In this state, the

        service will reject all API requests. ''error'': The Search service is in
        an

        error state. If your service is in the degraded, disabled, or error

        states, it means the Azure Search team is actively investigating the

        underlying issue. Dedicated services in these states are still chargeable

        based on the number of search units provisioned. Possible values include:

        Client applications can poll provisioning status (the recommended polling

        interval is from 30 seconds to one minute) by using the Get Search Service

        operation to see when an operation is completed. If you are using the free

        service, this value tends to come back as ''succeeded'' directly in the call

        to Create Search service. This is because the free service uses capacity

        that is already set up. Possible values include: ''succeeded'',

        ''provisioning'', ''failed''
