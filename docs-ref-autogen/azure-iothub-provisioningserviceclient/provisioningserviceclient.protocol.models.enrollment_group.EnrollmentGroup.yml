        ''geoLatency'':  Devices are provisioned to an IoT hub with the lowest

        latency to the device.If multiple linked IoT hubs would provide the same

        lowest latency, the provisioning service hashes devices across those hubs,

        takes priority over the service-level allocation policy, ''custom'': Devices

        are provisioned to an IoT hub based on your own custom logic. The

        provisioning service passes information about the device to the logic, and

        the logic returns the desired IoT hub as well as the desired initial

        configuration. We recommend using Azure Functions to host your logic.
