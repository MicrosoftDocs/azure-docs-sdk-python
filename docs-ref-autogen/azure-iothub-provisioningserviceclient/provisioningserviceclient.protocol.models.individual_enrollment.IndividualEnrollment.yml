      IoT hubs are equally likely to have devices provisioned to them,

      ''geoLatency'':  Devices are provisioned to an IoT hub with the lowest

      latency to the device.If multiple linked IoT hubs would provide the same

      lowest latency, the provisioning service hashes devices across those hubs,

      ''static'' : Specification of the desired IoT hub in the enrollment list

      takes priority over the service-level allocation policy, ''custom'': Devices

      are provisioned to an IoT hub based on your own custom logic. The

      provisioning service passes information about the device to the logic, and

      the logic returns the desired IoT hub as well as the desired initial

      configuration. We recommend using Azure Functions to host your logic.
