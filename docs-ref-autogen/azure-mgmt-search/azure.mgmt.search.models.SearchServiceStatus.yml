summary: 'The status of the search service. Possible values include: ''running'':
  The search service is

  running and no provisioning operations are underway. ''provisioning'': The search
  service is

  being provisioned or scaled up or down. ''deleting'': The search service is being
  deleted.

  ''degraded'': The search service is degraded. This can occur when the underlying
  search units are

  not healthy. The search service is most likely operational, but performance might
  be slow and

  some requests might be dropped. ''disabled'': The search service is disabled. In
  this state, the

  service will reject all API requests. ''error'': The search service is in an error
  state. If your

  service is in the degraded, disabled, or error states, it means the Azure Cognitive
  Search team

  is actively investigating the underlying issue. Dedicated services in these states
  are still

  chargeable based on the number of search units provisioned.'
