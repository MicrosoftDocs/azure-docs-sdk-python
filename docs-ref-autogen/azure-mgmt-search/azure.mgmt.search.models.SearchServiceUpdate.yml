    state. If your service is in the degraded, disabled, or error states, it means

    polling interval is

    from 30 seconds to one minute) by using the Get Search Service operation to see
    when an

    operation is completed. If you are using the free service, this value tends to
    come back as

    ''succeeded'' directly in the call to Create search service. This is because the

    uses capacity that is already set up. Possible values include: "succeeded", "provisioning",
