summary: 'The state of the last provisioning operation performed on the search service.
  Provisioning is

  an intermediate state that occurs while service capacity is being established. After
  capacity

  is set up, provisioningState changes to either ''succeeded'' or ''failed''. Client
  applications can

  poll provisioning status (the recommended polling interval is from 30 seconds to
  one minute) by

  using the Get Search Service operation to see when an operation is completed. If
  you are using

  the free service, this value tends to come back as ''succeeded'' directly in the
  call to Create

  search service. This is because the free service uses capacity that is already set
  up.'
