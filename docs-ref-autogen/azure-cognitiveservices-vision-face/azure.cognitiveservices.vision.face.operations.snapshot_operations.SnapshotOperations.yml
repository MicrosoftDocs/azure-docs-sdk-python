  summary: 'Submit an operation to apply a snapshot to current subscription. For

    each snapshot, only subscriptions included in the applyScope of

    Snapshot - Take can apply it.<br />

    The snapshot interfaces are for users to backup and restore their face

    data from one face subscription to another, inside same region or

    across regions. The workflow contains two phases, user first calls

    Snapshot - Take to create a copy of the source object and store it as a

    snapshot, then calls Snapshot - Apply to paste the snapshot to target

    subscription. The snapshots are stored in a centralized location (per

    Azure instance), so that they can be applied cross accounts and

    regions.<br />

    Applying snapshot is an asynchronous operation. An operation id can be

    obtained from the "Operation-Location" field in response header, to be

    used in OperationStatus - Get for tracking the progress of applying the

    snapshot. The target object id will be included in the

    "resourceLocation" field in OperationStatus - Get response when the

    operation status is "succeeded".<br />

    Snapshot applying time depends on the number of person and face entries

    in the snapshot object. It could be in seconds, or up to 1 hour for

    1,000,000 persons with multiple faces.<br />

    Snapshots will be automatically expired and cleaned in 48 hours after

    it is created by Snapshot - Take. So the target subscription is

    required to apply the snapshot in 48 hours since its creation.<br />

    Applying a snapshot will not block any other operations against the

    target object, however it is not recommended because the correctness

    cannot be guaranteed during snapshot applying. After snapshot applying

    is completed, all operations towards the target object can work as

    normal. Snapshot also includes the training results of the source

    object, which means target subscription the snapshot applied to does

    not need re-train the target object before calling

    Identify/FindSimilar.<br />

    One snapshot can be applied multiple times in parallel, while currently

    only CreateNew apply mode is supported, which means the apply operation

    will fail if target subscription already contains an object of same

    type and using the same objectId. Users can specify the "objectId" in

    request body to avoid such conflicts.<br />
