  summary: 'Storage Analytics logs detailed information about successful and failed
    requests

    to a storage service. This information can be used to monitor individual requests

    and to diagnose issues with a storage service. Requests are logged on a best-effort

    basis.


    All logs are stored in block blobs in a container named $logs, which is

    automatically created when Storage Analytics is enabled for a storage account.

    The $logs container is located in the blob namespace of the storage account.

    This container cannot be deleted once Storage Analytics has been enabled, though

    its contents can be deleted.
