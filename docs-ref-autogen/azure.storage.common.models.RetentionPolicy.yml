  summary: 'By default, Storage Analytics will not delete any logging or metrics data.
    Blobs

    will continue to be written until the shared 20TB limit is

    reached. Once the 20TB limit is reached, Storage Analytics will stop writing

    new data and will not resume until free space is available. This 20TB limit

    is independent of the total limit for your storage account.


    There are two ways to delete Storage Analytics data: by manually making deletion

    requests or by setting a data retention policy. Manual requests to delete Storage

    Analytics data are billable, but delete requests resulting from a retention policy

    are not billable.
