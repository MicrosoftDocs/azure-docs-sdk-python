summary: 'Evaluates coherence score for a given query and response or a multi-turn
  conversation, including reasoning.


  The coherence measure assesses the ability of the language model to generate text
  that reads naturally,

  flows smoothly, and resembles human-like language in its responses. Use it when
  assessing the readability

  and user-friendliness of a model''s generated responses in real-world applications.


  > [!NOTE]

  > To align with our support of a diverse set of models, an output key without the
  gpt_ prefix has been added.

  >

  > To maintain backwards compatibility, the old key with the gpt_ prefix is still
  be present in the output;

  >

  > however, it is recommended to use the new key moving forward as the old key will
  be deprecated in the future.
