summary: 'Calculates the GLEU (Google-BLEU) score between a response and the ground
  truth.


  The GLEU (Google-BLEU) score evaluator measures the similarity between generated
  and reference texts by

  evaluating n-gram overlap, considering both precision and recall. This balanced
  evaluation, designed for

  sentence-level assessment, makes it ideal for detailed analysis of translation quality.
  GLEU is well-suited for

  use cases such as machine translation, text summarization, and text generation.


  GLEU scores range from 0 to 1, where a value of 1 represents perfect overlap between
  the response and

  the ground truth and a value of 0 indicates no overlap.'
