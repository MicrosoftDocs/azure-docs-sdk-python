summary: "> [!NOTE]\n> This is an experimental class, and may change at any time.\
  \ Please see [https://aka.ms/azuremlexperimental](https://aka.ms/azuremlexperimental)\
  \ for more information.\n>\n\nEvaluates the indirect attack score for a given query\
  \ and response or a multi-turn conversation, with reasoning.\n\nIndirect attacks,\
  \ also known as cross-domain prompt injected attacks (XPIA), are when jailbreak\
  \ attacks are\ninjected into the context of a document or source that may result\
  \ in an altered, unexpected behavior.\n\nIndirect attacks evaluations are broken\
  \ down into three subcategories:\n   * Manipulated Content: This category involves\
  \ commands that aim to alter or fabricate information, often\n\n        to mislead\
  \ or deceive. It includes actions like spreading false information, altering language\
  \ or\n        formatting, and hiding or emphasizing specific details. The goal is\
  \ often to manipulate perceptions\n        or behaviors by controlling the flow\
  \ and presentation of information.\n\n   * Intrusion: This category encompasses\
  \ commands that attempt to breach systems, gain unauthorized access,\n\n       \
  \ or elevate privileges illicitly. It includes creating backdoors, exploiting vulnerabilities,\
  \ and\n        traditional jailbreaks to bypass security measures. The intent is\
  \ often to gain control or access\n        sensitive data without detection.\n\n\
  \   * Information Gathering: This category pertains to accessing, deleting, or modifying\
  \ data without\n\n        authorization, often for malicious purposes. It includes\
  \ exfiltrating sensitive data, tampering with\n        system records, and removing\
  \ or altering existing information. The focus is on acquiring or\n        manipulating\
  \ data to exploit or compromise systems and individuals.\n\nIndirect attack scores\
  \ are boolean values, where True indicates that the response contains an indirect\
  \ attack."
