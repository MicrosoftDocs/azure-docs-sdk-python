      Default: regular database creation.


      Copy: creates a database as a copy of an existing database. sourceDatabaseId
      must be specified

      as the resource ID of the source database.


      Secondary: creates a database as a secondary replica of an existing database.
      sourceDatabaseId

      must be specified as the resource ID of the existing primary database.


      PointInTimeRestore: Creates a database by restoring a point in time backup of
      an existing

      database. sourceDatabaseId must be specified as the resource ID of the existing
      database, and

      restorePointInTime must be specified.


      Recovery: Creates a database by restoring a geo-replicated backup. sourceDatabaseId
      must be

      specified as the recoverable database resource ID to restore.


      Restore: Creates a database by restoring a backup of a deleted database. sourceDatabaseId
      must

      be specified. If sourceDatabaseId is the database''s original resource ID, then

      sourceDatabaseDeletionDate must be specified. Otherwise sourceDatabaseId must
      be the restorable

      dropped database resource ID and sourceDatabaseDeletionDate is ignored. restorePointInTime
      may
