  summary: 'Information about the dead letter destination for an event subscription.
    To

    configure a deadletter destination, do not directly instantiate an object

    of this class. Instead, instantiate an object of a derived class.

    Currently, StorageBlobDeadLetterDestination is the only class that derives

    from this class.


    You probably want to use the sub-classes and not this class directly. Known

    sub-classes are: StorageBlobDeadLetterDestination
