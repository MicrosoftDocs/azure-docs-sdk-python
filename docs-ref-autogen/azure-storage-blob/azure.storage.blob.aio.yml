  - name: credential
    description: 'The credentials with which to authenticate. This is optional if
      the

      blob URL already has a SAS token or the blob is public. The value can be a SAS
      token string,

      an instance of a AzureSasCredential or AzureNamedKeyCredential from azure.core.credentials,

      an account shared access key, or an instance of a TokenCredentials class from
      azure.identity.

      If the resource URI already contains a SAS token, this will be ignored in favor
      of an explicit credential

      - except in the case of AzureSasCredential, where the conflicting SAS tokens
      will raise a ValueError.

      If using an instance of AzureNamedKeyCredential, "name" should be the storage
      account name, and "key"

      should be the storage account key.'

    description: 'If true, calculates an MD5 hash for each chunk of the blob. The

      blob. Also note that if enabled, the memory-efficient upload algorithm

      will not be used, because computing the MD5 hash requires buffering

      entire blocks, and doing so defeats the purpose of the memory-efficient algorithm.'
