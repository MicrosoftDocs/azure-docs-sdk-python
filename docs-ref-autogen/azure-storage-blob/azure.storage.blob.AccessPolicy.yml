summary: 'Access Policy class used by the set and get access policy methods in each
  service.


  A stored access policy can specify the start time, expiry time, and

  permissions for the Shared Access Signatures with which it''s associated.

  Depending on how you want to control access to your resource, you can

  specify all of these parameters within the stored access policy, and omit

  them from the URL for the Shared Access Signature. Doing so permits you to

  modify the associated signature''s behavior at any time, as well as to revoke

  it. Or you can specify one or more of the access policy parameters within

  the stored access policy, and the others on the URL. Finally, you can

  specify all of the parameters on the URL. In this case, you can use the

  stored access policy to revoke the signature, but not to modify its behavior.


  Together the Shared Access Signature and the stored access policy must

  include all fields required to authenticate the signature. If any required

  fields are missing, the request will fail. Likewise, if a field is specified

  both in the Shared Access Signature URL and in the stored access policy, the

  request will fail with status code 400 (Bad Request).'
