  leverage the availability and scalability of Azure''s Cloud Infrastructure as

  The Azure File service also offers a compelling alternative to traditional

  Direct Attached Storage (DAS) and Storage Area Network (SAN) solutions, which

  are often complex and expensive to install, configure, and operate.'
