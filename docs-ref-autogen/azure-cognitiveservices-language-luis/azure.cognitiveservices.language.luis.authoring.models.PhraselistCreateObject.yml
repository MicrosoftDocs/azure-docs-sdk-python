    description: 'An interchangeable phrase list feature serves as a

      list contains 5 phrases, they will be mapped to 5 separate features. You

      can think of the non-interchangeable phrase list as an additional bag of

      words to add to LUIS existing vocabulary features. It is used as a lexicon

      lookup feature where its value is 1 if the lexicon contains a given word

      or 0 if it doesn''t.  Default value is true. Default value: True .'
