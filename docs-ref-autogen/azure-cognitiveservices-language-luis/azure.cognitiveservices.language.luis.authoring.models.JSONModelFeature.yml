      features for training. So, if your non-interchangeable phrase list

      contains 5 phrases, they will be mapped to 5 separate features. You can

      think of the non-interchangeable phrase list as an additional bag of words

      to add to LUIS existing vocabulary features. It is used as a lexicon

      lookup feature where its value is 1 if the lexicon contains a given word

      or 0 if it doesn''t.  Default value is true.'
