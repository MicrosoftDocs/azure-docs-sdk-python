    description: 'An exchangeable phrase list feature are serves as

      single feature to the LUIS underlying training algorithm. It is used as a

      lexicon lookup feature where its value is 1 if the lexicon contains a

      given word or 0 if it doesn''t. Think of an exchangeable as a synonyms

      list. A non-exchangeable phrase list feature has all the phrases in the

      list serve as separate features to the underlying training algorithm. So,

      if you your phrase list feature contains 5 phrases, they will be mapped to

      5 separate features. You can think of the non-exchangeable phrase list

      feature as an additional bag of words that you are willing to add to LUIS

      existing vocabulary features. Think of a non-exchangeable as set of

      different words. Default value is true. Default value: True .'
