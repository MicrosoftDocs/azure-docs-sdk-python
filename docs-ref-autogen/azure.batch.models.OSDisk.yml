        the same subscription and same region as the Batch account. For best

        performance, it is recommended that each VHD resides in a separate Azure

        Storage account. Each VHD can serve upto 20 Windows compute nodes or 40

        Linux compute nodes. You must supply enough VHD URIs to satisfy the

        ''targetDedicated'' property of the pool. If you do not supply enough VHD

        URIs, the pool will partially allocate compute nodes, and a resize error

        will occur.
