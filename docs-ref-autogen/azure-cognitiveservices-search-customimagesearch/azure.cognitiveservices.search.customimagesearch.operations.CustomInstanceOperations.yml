    description: 'Bing uses this header to provide users with

      consistent behavior across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new

      features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for

      assigning traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same

      client ID for a user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign

      the user to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple

      conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience. For

      example, if the second request has a different flight assignment than

      the first, the experience may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use the

      client ID to tailor web results to that client ID''s search history,

      providing a richer experience for the user. Bing also uses this header

      to help improve result rankings by analyzing the activity generated by

      a client ID. The relevance improvements help with better quality of

      results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher

      click-through rates for the API consumer. IMPORTANT: Although

      optional, you should consider this header required. Persisting the

      client ID across multiple requests for the same end user and device

      combination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a consistent user

      experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better quality of

      results from the Bing APIs. Each user that uses your application on

      the device must have a unique, Bing generated client ID. If you do not

      include this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns

      it in the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you

      should NOT include this header in a request is the first time the user

      uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API

      request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist the

      client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP

      cookie to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not use a

      session cookie. For other apps such as mobile apps, use the device''s

      persistent storage to persist the ID. The next time the user uses your

      app on that device, get the client ID that you persisted. Bing

      responses may or may not include this header. If the response includes

      this header, capture the client ID and use it for all subsequent Bing

      requests for the user on that device. If you include the

      1, 1970.) head (optional): The client''s relative heading or direction

      the possible filter values. Off: May return images with adult content.

      If the request is through the Image Search API, the response includes

      thumbnail images that are clear (non-fuzzy). However, if the request

      is through the Web Search API, the response includes thumbnail images

      that are pixelated (fuzzy). Moderate: If the request is through the

      Image Search API, the response doesn''t include images with adult

      content. If the request is through the Web Search API, the response

      may include images with adult content (the thumbnail images are

      pixelated (fuzzy)). Strict: Do not return images with adult content.

      The default is Moderate. If the request comes from a market that

      Bing''s adult policy requires that safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing

      ignores the safeSearch value and uses Strict. If you use the site:

      query operator, there is the chance that the response may contain

      adult content regardless of what the safeSearch query parameter is set

      to. Use site: only if you are aware of the content on the site and

      your scenario supports the possibility of adult content. Possible

      values include: ''Off'', ''Moderate'', ''Strict'''
