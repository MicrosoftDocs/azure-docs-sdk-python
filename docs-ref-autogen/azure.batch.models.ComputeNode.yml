        reimaging - The node is reimaging.

        running - The node is running one or more tasks (other than a start task).

        unusable - The node cannot be used for task execution due to errors.

        creating - The Batch service has obtained the underlying virtual machine

        from Azure Compute, but it has not yet started to join the pool.

        starting - the Batch service is starting on the underlying virtual

        machine.

        waitingforstarttask - The start task has started running on the compute

        node, but waitForSuccess is set and the start task has not yet completed.

        starttaskfailed - The start task has failed on the compute node (and

        exhausted all retries), and waitForSuccess is set. The node is not usable

        for running tasks.

        unknown - The Batch service has lost contact with the node, and does not

        know its true state.

        leavingpool - The node is leaving the pool, either because the user

        explicitly removed it or because the pool is resizing or autoscaling down.

        offline - The node is not currently running a task, and scheduling of new

        tasks to the node is disabled.

        preempted - The low-priority node has been preempted. Tasks which were

        running on the node when it was pre-empted will be rescheduled when

        another node becomes available. Possible values include: ''idle'',

        ''rebooting'', ''reimaging'', ''running'', ''unusable'', ''creating'', ''starting'',
