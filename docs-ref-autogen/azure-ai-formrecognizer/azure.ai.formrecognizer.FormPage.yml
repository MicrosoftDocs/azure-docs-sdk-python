- uid: azure.ai.formrecognizer.FormPage.lines
  name: lines
  summary: 'When *include_field_elements* is set to true, a list of recognized text
    lines is returned.

    For calls to recognize content, this list is always populated. The maximum number
    of lines

    returned is 300 per page. The lines are sorted top to bottom, left to right, although
    in

    certain cases proximity is treated with higher priority. As the sorting order
    depends on

    the detected text, it may change across images and OCR version updates. Thus,
    business

    logic should be built upon the actual line location instead of order. The reading
    order

    of lines can be specified by the *reading_order* keyword argument (Note: *reading_order*

    only supported in *begin_recognize_content* and *begin_recognize_content_from_url*).'
