  summary: "Join offline features in a spark dataframe. Requires spark context.\n\n\
    Enrich an entity dataframe with historical feature values for either training\
    \ or batch scoring.\nThis method joins historical feature data from one or more\
    \ feature sets to an entity dataframe by using a time\ntravel join.\n\nEach feature\
    \ set is joined to the entity dataframe using all entities configured for the\
    \ respective feature set.\n\nAll configured entities must be available in the\
    \ entity dataframe. Therefore, the entity dataframe must\ncontain all entities\
    \ found in all feature sets, but the individual feature sets can have different\
    \ entities.\n\nTime travel is based on the configured temporal join lookback for\
    \ each feature set. A shorter lookback will limit\nthe amount of scanning that\
    \ will be done in order to find feature data for a specific entity key. Setting\
    \ a short\nlookback period may result in null values being returned.\n:param observation_data:\
