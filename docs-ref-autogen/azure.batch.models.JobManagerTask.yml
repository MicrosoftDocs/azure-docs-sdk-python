  summary: 'Specifies details of a Job Manager task.


    The Job Manager task is automatically started when the job is created. The

    Batch service tries to schedule the Job Manager task before any other tasks

    in the job. When shrinking a pool, the Batch service tries to preserve

    compute nodes where Job Manager tasks are running for as long as possible

    (that is, nodes running ''normal'' tasks are removed before nodes running Job

    Manager tasks). When a Job Manager task fails and needs to be restarted,

    the system tries to schedule it at the highest priority. If there are no

    idle nodes available, the system may terminate one of the running tasks in

    the pool and return it to the queue in order to make room for the Job

    Manager task to restart. Note that a Job Manager task in one job does not

    have priority over tasks in other jobs. Across jobs, only job level

    priorities are observed. For example, if a Job Manager in a priority 0 job

    needs to be restarted, it will not displace tasks of a priority 1 job.

        onAllTasksComplete attribute to terminate the job, or have a client or

        user terminate the job explicitly. An example of this is if the Job

        Manager creates a set of tasks but then takes no further role in their
