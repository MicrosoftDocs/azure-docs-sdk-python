summary: 'Specifies the detach behavior to be used while detaching a disk or which
  is already in the

  process of detachment from the virtual machine. Supported values are: **ForceDetach.**

  detachOption: **ForceDetach** is applicable only for managed data disks. If a previous

  detachment attempt of the data disk did not complete due to an unexpected failure
  from the

  virtual machine and the disk is still not released then use force-detach as a last
  resort

  option to detach the disk forcibly from the VM. All writes might not have been flushed
  when

  using this detach behavior. **This feature is still in preview** mode and is not
  supported for

  VirtualMachineScaleSet. To force-detach a data disk update toBeDetached to ''true''
  along with

  setting detachOption: ''ForceDetach''.'
