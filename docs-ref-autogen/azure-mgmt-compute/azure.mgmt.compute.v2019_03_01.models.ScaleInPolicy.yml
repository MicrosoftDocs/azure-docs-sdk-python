    <br><br> Possible values are: <br><br> Default When a

    virtual machine scale set is scaled in, the scale set will first be balanced across
    zones if it

    is a zonal scale set. Then, it will be balanced across Fault Domains as far as
    possible. Within

    each Fault Domain, the virtual machines chosen for removal will be the newest
    ones that are not

    protected from scale-in. <br><br> OldestVM When a virtual machine scale set

    is being scaled-in, the oldest virtual machines that are not protected from scale-in
    will be
