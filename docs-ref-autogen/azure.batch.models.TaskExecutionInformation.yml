        corresponds to the running state, so if the task specifies resource files

        or application packages, then the start time reflects the time at which

        the task started downloading or deploying these. If the task has been

        restarted or retried, this is the most recent time at which the task

        started running. This property is present only for tasks that are in the

        running or completed state.

        you use the exit code value to make decisions in your code, be sure that

        you know the exit code convention used by the application process.

        However, if the Batch service terminates the task (due to timeout, or user

        termination via the API) you may see an operating system-defined exit

        code.
