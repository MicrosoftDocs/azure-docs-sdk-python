summary: 'This represents the blob storage account location where exports of costs
  will be delivered.

  There are two ways to configure the destination. The approach recommended for most
  customers is

  to specify the resourceId of the storage account. This requires a one-time registration
  of the

  account''s subscription with the Microsoft.CostManagementExports resource provider
  in order to

  give Cost Management services access to the storage. When creating an export in
  the Azure

  portal this registration is performed automatically but API users may need to register
  the

  subscription explicitly (for more information see

  [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-supported-services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-supported-services)

  ). Another way to configure the destination is available ONLY to Partners with a
  Microsoft

  Partner Agreement plan who are global admins of their billing account. These Partners,
  instead

  of specifying the resourceId of a storage account, can specify the storage account
  name along

  with a SAS token for the account. This allows exports of costs to a storage account
  in any

  tenant. The SAS token should be created for the blob service with Service/Container/Object

  resource types and with Read/Write/Delete/List/Add/Create permissions (for more
  information see
