  summary: 'This API is the replacement for all previously release Usage Details APIs.
    Request to generate

    a cost details report for the provided date range, billing period (Only enterprise
    customers)

    or Invoice Id asynchronously at a certain scope. The initial call to request a
    report will

    return a 202 with a ''Location'' and ''Retry-After'' header. The ''Location''
    header will provide the

    endpoint to poll to get the result of the report generation. The ''Retry-After''
    provides the

    duration to wait before polling for the generated report. A call to poll the report
    operation

    will provide a 202 response with a ''Location'' header if the operation is still
    in progress.

    Once the report generation operation completes, the polling endpoint will provide
    a 200

    response along with details on the report blob(s) that are available for download.
    The details

    on the file(s) available for download will be available in the polling response
    body. To
