    description: 'Required. The property of the health information. An

      entity can have health reports for different properties.

      The property is a string and not a fixed enumeration to allow the reporter

      flexibility to categorize the state condition that triggers the report.

      For example, a reporter with SourceId "LocalWatchdog" can monitor the

      state of the available disk on a node,

      so it can report "AvailableDisk" property on that node.

      The same reporter can monitor the node connectivity, so it can report a

      property "Connectivity" on the same node.

      In the health store, these reports are treated as separate health events

      for the specified node.

      Together with the SourceId, the property uniquely identifies the health

      information.'

      If clients report on transition, they can set the time to live to

      infinite.

      When time to live expires, the health event that contains the health

      If set to true, the report is removed from the health store after it

      expires.

      If set to false, the report is treated as an error when expired. The value

      of this property is false by default.

      When clients report periodically, they should set RemoveWhenExpired false

      (default).

      This way, if the reporter has issues (e.g. deadlock) and can''t report, the

      entity is evaluated at error when the health report expires.
