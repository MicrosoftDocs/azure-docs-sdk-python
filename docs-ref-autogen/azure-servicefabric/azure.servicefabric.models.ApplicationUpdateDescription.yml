    description: 'Flags indicating whether other properties are set. Each of

      the associated properties corresponds to a flag, specified below, which,

      if set, indicate that the property is specified.

      If flags are not specified for a certain property, the property will not

      be updated even if the new value is provided.

      This property can be a combination of those flags obtained using bitwise

      ''OR'' operator. Exception is RemoveApplicationCapacity which cannot be

      specified along with other parameters.

      For example, if the provided value is 3 then the flags for MinimumNodes

      (1) and MaximumNodes (2) are set.

      - None - Does not indicate any other properties are set. The value is 0.

      - MinimumNodes - Indicates whether the MinimumNodes property is set. The

      value is 1.

      - MaximumNodes - Indicates whether the MinimumNodes property is set. The

      value is  2.

      - ApplicationMetrics - Indicates whether the ApplicationMetrics property

      is set. The value is 4.'
