summary: 'Describes the policy to be used for placement of a Service Fabric service

  where two replicas from the same partition should never be placed in the

  same fault or upgrade domain.

  While this is not common it can expose the service to an increased risk of

  concurrent failures due to unplanned outages or other cases of

  subsequent/concurrent failures. As an example, consider a case where

  replicas are deployed across different data center, with one replica per

  location. In the event that one of the datacenters goes offline, normally

  the replica that was placed in that datacenter will be packed into one of

  the remaining datacenters. If this is not desirable then this policy should

  be set.
