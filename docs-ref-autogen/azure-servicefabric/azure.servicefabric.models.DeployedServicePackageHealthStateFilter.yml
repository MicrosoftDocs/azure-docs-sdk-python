summary: 'Defines matching criteria to determine whether a deployed service package

  should be included as a child of a deployed application in the cluster

  health chunk.

  The deployed service packages are only returned if the parent entities

  match a filter specified in the cluster health chunk query description. The

  parent deployed application and its parent application must be included in

  the cluster health chunk.

  One filter can match zero, one or multiple deployed service packages,

  depending on its properties.'

    description: 'The filter for the health state of the

      deployed service packages. It allows selecting deployed service packages

      if they match the desired health states.

      The possible values are integer value of one of the following health

      states. Only deployed service packages that match the filter are returned.

      All deployed service packages are used to evaluate the parent deployed

      application aggregated health state.

      If not specified, default value is None, unless the deployed service

      package ID is specified. If the filter has default value and deployed

      service package ID is specified, the matching deployed service package is

      returned.

      The state values are flag-based enumeration, so the value could be a

      combination of these values obtained using bitwise ''OR'' operator.

      For example, if the provided value is 6, it matches deployed service

      packages with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4).

      - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.

      - None - Filter that doesn''t match any HealthState value. Used in order to

      return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.

      - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is

      2.

      - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The

      value is 4.

      - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The

      value is 8.

      - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is

      65535. Default value: 0 .'
