summary: 'Defines matching criteria to determine whether a service should be included

    description: 'The filter for the health state of the

      services. It allows selecting services if they match the desired health

      states.

      The possible values are integer value of one of the following health

      states. Only services that match the filter are returned. All services are

      used to evaluate the cluster aggregated health state.

      If not specified, default value is None, unless the service name is

      specified. If the filter has default value and service name is specified,

      the matching service is returned.

      The state values are flag-based enumeration, so the value could be a

      combination of these values obtained using bitwise ''OR'' operator.

      For example, if the provided value is 6, it matches services with

      HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4).

      - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.

      - None - Filter that doesn''t match any HealthState value. Used in order to

      return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.

      - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is

      2.

      - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The

      value is 4.

      - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The

      value is 8.

      - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is

      65535. Default value: 0 .'

      If the list is empty, no partitions are returned. All the partitions are

      used to evaluate the parent service aggregated health state, regardless of

      the input filters.

      The service filter may specify multiple partition filters.

      For example, it can specify a filter to return all partitions with health

      state Error and another filter to always include a partition identified by

      its partition ID.'
