    description: 'Flags indicating whether other properties are set. Each of

      the associated properties corresponds to a flag, specified below, which,

      if set, indicate that the property is specified.

      This property can be a combination of those flags obtained using bitwise

      ''OR'' operator.

      For example, if the provided value is 6 then the flags for

      ReplicaRestartWaitDuration (2) and QuorumLossWaitDuration (4) are set.

      - None - Does not indicate any other properties are set. The value is

      zero.

      - TargetReplicaSetSize/InstanceCount - Indicates whether the

      TargetReplicaSetSize property (for Stateful services) or the InstanceCount

      property (for Stateless services) is set. The value is 1.

      - ReplicaRestartWaitDuration - Indicates the ReplicaRestartWaitDuration

      property is set. The value is  2.

      - QuorumLossWaitDuration - Indicates the QuorumLossWaitDuration property

      is set. The value is 4.

      - StandByReplicaKeepDuration - Indicates the StandByReplicaKeepDuration

      property is set. The value is 8.

      - MinReplicaSetSize - Indicates the MinReplicaSetSize property is set. The

      value is 16.

      - PlacementConstraints - Indicates the PlacementConstraints property is

      set. The value is 32.

      - PlacementPolicyList - Indicates the ServicePlacementPolicies property is

      set. The value is 64.

      - Correlation - Indicates the CorrelationScheme property is set. The value

      is 128.

      - Metrics - Indicates the ServiceLoadMetrics property is set. The value is

      256.

      - DefaultMoveCost - Indicates the DefaultMoveCost property is set. The

      value is 512.

      - ScalingPolicy - Indicates the ScalingPolicies property is set. The value

      is 1024.

      - ServicePlacementTimeLimit - Indicates the ServicePlacementTimeLimit

      property is set. The value is 2048.
