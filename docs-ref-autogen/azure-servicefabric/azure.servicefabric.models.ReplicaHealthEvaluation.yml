      uniquely identify a replica of a partition of a stateful service or an

      instance of a stateless service partition. It is unique within a partition

      and does not change for the lifetime of the replica or the instance. If a

      stateful replica gets dropped and another replica gets created on the same

      node for the same partition, it will get a different value for the ID. If

      a stateless instance is failed over on the same or different node it will

      get a different value for the ID.'
