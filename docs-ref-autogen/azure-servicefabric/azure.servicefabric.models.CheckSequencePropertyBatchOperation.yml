summary: 'Compares the Sequence Number of a property with the SequenceNumber

  argument.

  A property''s sequence number can be thought of as that property''s version.

  Every time the property is modified, its sequence number is increased.

  The sequence number can be found in a property''s metadata.

  The comparison fails if the sequence numbers are not equal.

  CheckSequencePropertyBatchOperation is generally used as a precondition for

  the write operations in the batch.

  Note that if one PropertyBatchOperation in a PropertyBatch fails,

  the entire batch fails and cannot be committed in a transactional manner.


  All required parameters must be populated in order to send to Azure.'
