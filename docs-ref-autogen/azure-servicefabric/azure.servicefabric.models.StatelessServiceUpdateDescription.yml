        ''OR'' operator.

        For example, if the provided value is 6 then the flags for

        ReplicaRestartWaitDuration (2) and QuorumLossWaitDuration (4) are set.

        - None - Does not indicate any other properties are set. The value is

        zero.

        - TargetReplicaSetSize/InstanceCount - Indicates whether the

        TargetReplicaSetSize property (for Stateful services) or the InstanceCount

        property (for Stateless services) is set. The value is 1.

        - ReplicaRestartWaitDuration - Indicates the ReplicaRestartWaitDuration

        property is set. The value is  2.

        set. The value is 32.

        - PlacementPolicyList - Indicates the ServicePlacementPolicies property is

        set. The value is 64.

        - Correlation - Indicates the CorrelationScheme property is set. The value

        is 128.

        - Metrics - Indicates the ServiceLoadMetrics property is set. The value is

        256.
