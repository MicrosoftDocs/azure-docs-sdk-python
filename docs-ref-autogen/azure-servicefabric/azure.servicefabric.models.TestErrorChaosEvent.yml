  summary: 'Describes a Chaos event that gets generated when an unexpected event occurs

    in the Chaos engine.

    For example, due to the cluster snapshot being inconsistent, while faulting

    an entity, Chaos found that the entity was already faulted -- which would

    be an unexpected event.
