    description: 'The filter for the health state of the

      deployed applications. It allows selecting deployed applications if they

      match the desired health states.

      The possible values are integer value of one of the following health

      states. Only deployed applications that match the filter are returned. All

      deployed applications are used to evaluate the cluster aggregated health

      state.

      If not specified, default value is None, unless the node name is

      specified. If the filter has default value and node name is specified, the

      matching deployed application is returned.

      The state values are flag-based enumeration, so the value could be a

      combination of these values obtained using bitwise ''OR'' operator.

      For example, if the provided value is 6, it matches deployed applications

      with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4).

      - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.

      - None - Filter that doesn''t match any HealthState value. Used in order to

      return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.

      - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is

      2.

      - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The

      value is 4.

      - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The

      value is 8.

      - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is

      65535. Default value: 0 .'
