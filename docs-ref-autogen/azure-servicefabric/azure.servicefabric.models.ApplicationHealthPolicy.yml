      The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of deployed

      error.

      This is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy deployed

      applications over the number of nodes where the application is currently

      deployed on in the cluster.

      The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of

      nodes. Default percentage is zero. Default value: 0 .'
