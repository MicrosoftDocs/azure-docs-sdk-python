      that can be unhealthy before the service is considered in error.

      If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy

      partition, the health is evaluated as Warning.

      The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy

      partitions over the total number of partitions in the service.

      The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of

      partitions. Default percentage is zero. Default value: 0 .'
