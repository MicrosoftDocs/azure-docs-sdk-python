    description: 'The filter for the health state of the

      applications. It allows selecting applications if they match the desired

      health states.

      The possible values are integer value of one of the following health

      states. Only applications that match the filter are returned. All

      applications are used to evaluate the cluster aggregated health state.

      If not specified, default value is None, unless the application name or

      the application type name are specified. If the filter has default value

      and application name is specified, the matching application is returned.

      The state values are flag-based enumeration, so the value could be a

      combination of these values obtained using bitwise ''OR'' operator.

      For example, if the provided value is 6, it matches applications with

      HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4).

      - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.

      - None - Filter that doesn''t match any HealthState value. Used in order to

      return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.

      - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is

      2.

      - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The

      value is 4.

      - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The

      value is 8.

      - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is
