summary: 'Defines all filters for targeted Chaos faults, for example, faulting only

  certain node types or faulting only certain applications.

  If ChaosTargetFilter is not used, Chaos faults all cluster entities. If

  ChaosTargetFilter is used, Chaos faults only the entities that meet the

  ChaosTargetFilter

  specification. NodeTypeInclusionList and ApplicationInclusionList allow a

  union semantics only. It is not possible to specify an intersection

  of NodeTypeInclusionList and ApplicationInclusionList. For example, it is

  not possible to specify "fault this application only when it is on that

  node type."

  Once an entity is included in either NodeTypeInclusionList or

  ApplicationInclusionList, that entity cannot be excluded using

  ChaosTargetFilter. Even if

  applicationX does not appear in ApplicationInclusionList, in some Chaos

  iteration applicationX can be faulted because it happens to be on a node of

  nodeTypeY that is included

  in NodeTypeInclusionList. If both NodeTypeInclusionList and

  ApplicationInclusionList are null or empty, an ArgumentException is thrown.'

      faults.

      All types of faults (restart node, restart code package, remove replica,

      restart replica, move primary, and move secondary) are enabled for the

      nodes of these node types.

      If a node type (say NodeTypeX) does not appear in the

      NodeTypeInclusionList, then node level faults (like NodeRestart) will

      never be enabled for the nodes of

      NodeTypeX, but code package and replica faults can still be enabled for

      NodeTypeX if an application in the ApplicationInclusionList.

      happens to reside on a node of NodeTypeX.

      At most 100 node type names can be included in this list, to increase this

      number, a config upgrade is required for

      MaxNumberOfNodeTypesInChaosEntityFilter configuration.'

      in Chaos faults.

      All replicas belonging to services of these applications are amenable to

      replica faults (restart replica, remove replica, move primary, and move

      secondary) by Chaos.

      Chaos may restart a code package only if the code package hosts replicas

      of these applications only.

      If an application does not appear in this list, it can still be faulted in

      some Chaos iteration if the application ends up on a node of a node type

      that is included in NodeTypeInclusionList.

      However, if applicationX is tied to nodeTypeY through placement

      constraints and applicationX is absent from ApplicationInclusionList and

      nodeTypeY is absent from NodeTypeInclusionList, then applicationX will

      never be faulted.
