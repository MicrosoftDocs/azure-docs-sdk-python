summary: 'Describes the policy to be used for placement of a Service Fabric service

  where the service''s Primary replicas should optimally be placed in a

  particular domain.

  This placement policy is usually used with fault domains in scenarios where

  the Service Fabric cluster is geographically distributed in order to

  indicate that a service''s primary replica should be located in a particular

  fault domain, which in geo-distributed scenarios usually aligns with

  regional or datacenter boundaries. Note that since this is an optimization

  it is possible that the Primary replica may not end up located in this

  domain due to failures, capacity limits, or other constraints.


  All required parameters must be populated in order to send to Azure.'
