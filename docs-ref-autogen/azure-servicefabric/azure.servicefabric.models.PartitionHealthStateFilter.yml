  included as a child of a service in the cluster health chunk.

  The partitions are only returned if the parent entities match a filter

  specified in the cluster health chunk query description. The parent service

    description: 'The filter for the health state of the

      partitions. It allows selecting partitions if they match the desired

      health states.

      The possible values are integer value of one of the following health

      states. Only partitions that match the filter are returned. All partitions

      are used to evaluate the cluster aggregated health state.

      If not specified, default value is None, unless the partition ID is

      specified. If the filter has default value and partition ID is specified,

      the matching partition is returned.

      The state values are flag-based enumeration, so the value could be a

      combination of these values obtained using bitwise ''OR'' operator.

      For example, if the provided value is 6, it matches partitions with

      HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4).

      - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.

      - None - Filter that doesn''t match any HealthState value. Used in order to

      return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.

      - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is

      2.

      - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The

      value is 4.

      - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The

      value is 8.

      - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is

      65535. Default value: 0 .'

      to evaluate the parent partition aggregated health state, regardless of

      the input filters.
