      The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of

    description: 'Defines a map with max

      percentage unhealthy applications for specific application types.

      Each entry specifies as key the application type name and as value an

      integer that represents the MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications percentage

      used to evaluate the applications of the specified application type.

      The application type health policy map can be used during cluster health

      evaluation to describe special application types.

      The application types included in the map are evaluated against the

      percentage specified in the map, and not with the global

      MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications defined in the cluster health policy.

      The applications of application types specified in the map are not counted

      against the global pool of applications.

      For example, if some applications of a type are critical, the cluster

      administrator can add an entry to the map for that application type

      and assign it a value of 0% (that is, do not tolerate any failures).

      All other applications can be evaluated with

      MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications set to 20% to tolerate some failures out

      of the thousands of application instances.

      The application type health policy map is used only if the cluster

      manifest enables application type health evaluation using the

      configuration entry for

      HealthManager/EnableApplicationTypeHealthEvaluation.'

    description: 'Defines a map with max percentage

      unhealthy nodes for specific node types.

      Each entry specifies as key the node type name and as value an integer

      that represents the MaxPercentUnhealthyNodes percentage used to evaluate

      the nodes of the specified node type.

      The node type health policy map can be used during cluster health

      evaluation to describe special node types.

      They are evaluated against the percentages associated with their node type

      name in the map.

      Setting this has no impact on the global pool of nodes used for

      MaxPercentUnhealthyNodes.

      The node type health policy map is used only if the cluster manifest

      enables node type health evaluation using the configuration entry for

      HealthManager/EnableNodeTypeHealthEvaluation.

      For example, given a cluster with many nodes of different types, with

      important work hosted on node type "SpecialNodeType" that should not

      tolerate any nodes down.

      You can specify global MaxPercentUnhealthyNodes to 20% to tolerate some

      failures for all nodes, but for the node type "SpecialNodeType", set the

      MaxPercentUnhealthyNodes to 0 by

      setting the value in the key value pair in NodeTypeHealthPolicyMapItem.

      The key is the node type name.

      This way, as long as no nodes of type "SpecialNodeType" are in Error

      state,

      even if some of the many nodes in the global pool are in Error state, but

      below the global unhealthy percentage, the cluster would be evaluated to

      Warning.

      A Warning health state does not impact cluster upgrade or other monitoring

      triggered by Error health state.

      But even one node of type SpecialNodeType in Error would make cluster

      unhealthy (in Error rather than Warning/Ok), which triggers rollback or

      pauses the cluster upgrade, depending on the upgrade configuration.

      Conversely, setting the global MaxPercentUnhealthyNodes to 0, and setting

      SpecialNodeType''s max percent unhealthy nodes to 100,

      with one node of type SpecialNodeType in Error state would still put the

      cluster in an Error state, since the global restriction is more strict in

      this case.'
