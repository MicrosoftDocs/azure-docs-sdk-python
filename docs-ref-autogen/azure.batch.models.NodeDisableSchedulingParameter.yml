    - description: 'What to do with currently running

        tasks when disabling task scheduling on the compute node. Values are:

        requeue - Terminate running task processes and requeue the tasks. The

        tasks may run again on other compute nodes, or when task scheduling is

        re-enabled on this node. Enter offline state as soon as tasks have been

        terminated.

        terminate - Terminate running tasks. The tasks will not run again. Enter

        offline state as soon as tasks have been terminated.

        taskcompletion - Allow currently running tasks to complete. Schedule no

        new tasks while waiting. Enter offline state when all tasks have

        completed.

        The default value is requeue. Possible values include: ''requeue'',

        ''terminate'', ''taskCompletion''
