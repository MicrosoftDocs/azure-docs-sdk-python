  summary: 'The encoder can be configured to produce video and/or images (thumbnails)

    at different resolutions, by specifying a layer for each desired

    resolution. A layer represents the properties for the video or image at a

    resolution.


    You probably want to use the sub-classes and not this class directly. Known

    sub-classes are: VideoLayer, JpgLayer, PngLayer


    All required parameters must be populated in order to send to Azure.
