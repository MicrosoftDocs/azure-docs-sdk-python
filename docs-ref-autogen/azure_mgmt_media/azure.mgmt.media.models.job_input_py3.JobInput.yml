    sub-classes are: JobInputClip, JobInputs

    - description: 'A label that is assigned to a JobInput, that is used to

        satisfy a reference used in the Transform. For example, a Transform can be

        authored so as to take an image file with the label ''xyz'' and apply it as

        an overlay onto the input video before it is encoded. When submitting a

        Job, exactly one of the JobInputs should be the image file, and it should

        have the label ''xyz''.
