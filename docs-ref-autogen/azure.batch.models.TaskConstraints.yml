        this time, the Batch service may delete the task directory and all its

        contents. The default is infinite, i.e. the task directory will be

    - description: 'The maximum number of times the task may be

        retried. The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero.

        Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The

        Batch service will try the task once, and may then retry up to this limit.

        For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4

        times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0,

        the Batch service does not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is

        -1, the Batch service retries the task without limit.
