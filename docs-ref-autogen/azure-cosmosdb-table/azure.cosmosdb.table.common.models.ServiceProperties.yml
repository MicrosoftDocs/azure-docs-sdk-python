  summary: 'Returned by get_*_service_properties functions. Contains the properties
    of a

    storage service, including Analytics and CORS rules.


    Azure Storage Analytics performs logging and provides metrics data for a storage

    account. You can use this data to trace requests, analyze usage trends, and

    diagnose issues with your storage account. To use Storage Analytics, you must

    enable it individually for each service you want to monitor.


    The aggregated data is stored in a well-known blob (for logging) and in well-known

    tables (for metrics), which may be accessed using the Blob service and Table

    service APIs.


    For an in-depth guide on using Storage Analytics and other tools to identify,

    diagnose, and troubleshoot Azure Storage-related issues, see

    [http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/storage-monitoring-diagnosing-troubleshooting/](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/storage-monitoring-diagnosing-troubleshooting/)
