    are guaranteed to be available for read operations at the secondary.

    Primary writes after this point in time may or may not be available for

    reads. The value may be empty if LastSyncTime is not available. This can

    happen if the replication status is bootstrap or unavailable. Although

    geo-replication is continuously enabled, the LastSyncTime result may

    reflect a cached value from the service that is refreshed every few minutes.'
