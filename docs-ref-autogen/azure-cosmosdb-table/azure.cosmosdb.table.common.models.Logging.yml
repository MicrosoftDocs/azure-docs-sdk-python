summary: 'Storage Analytics logs detailed information about successful and failed
  requests

  to a storage service. This information can be used to monitor individual requests

  and to diagnose issues with a storage service. Requests are logged on a best-effort

  basis.


  All logs are stored in block blobs in a container named $logs, which is

  automatically created when Storage Analytics is enabled for a storage account.

  The $logs container is located in the blob namespace of the storage account.

  This container cannot be deleted once Storage Analytics has been enabled, though

  its contents can be deleted.
