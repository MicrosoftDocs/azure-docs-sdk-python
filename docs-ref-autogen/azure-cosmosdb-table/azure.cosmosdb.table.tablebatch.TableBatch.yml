summary: 'This is the class that is used for batch operation for storage table service.


  The Table service supports batch transactions on entities that are in the

  same table and belong to the same partition group. Multiple operations are

  supported within a single transaction. The batch can include at most 100

  entities, and its total payload may be no more than 4 MB in size.'
