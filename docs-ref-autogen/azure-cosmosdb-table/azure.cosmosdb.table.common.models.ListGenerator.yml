summary: 'A generator object used to list storage resources. The generator will lazily

  follow the continuation tokens returned by the service and stop when all

  resources have been returned or max_results is reached.


  If max_results is specified and the account has more than that number of

  resources, the generator will have a populated next_marker field once it

  finishes. This marker can be used to create a new generator if more

  results are desired.'
