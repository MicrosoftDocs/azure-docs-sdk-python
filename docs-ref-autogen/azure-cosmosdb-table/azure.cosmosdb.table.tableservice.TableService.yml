summary: 'This is the main class managing Azure Table resources.


  The Azure Table service offers structured storage in the form of tables. Tables

  store data as collections of entities. Entities are similar to rows. An entity

  has a primary key and a set of properties. A property is a name, typed-value pair,

  similar to a column. The Table service does not enforce any schema for tables,

  so two entities in the same table may have different sets of properties. Developers

  may choose to enforce a schema on the client side. A table may contain any number

  of entities.'
