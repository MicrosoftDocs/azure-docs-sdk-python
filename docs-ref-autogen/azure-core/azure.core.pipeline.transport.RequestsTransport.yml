fullName: azure.core.pipeline.transport.RequestsTransport
module: azure.core.pipeline.transport
inheritances:
- azure.core.pipeline.transport._base.HttpTransport
summary: 'Implements a basic requests HTTP sender.


  Since requests team recommends to use one session per requests, you should

  not consider this class as thread-safe, since it will use one Session

  per instance.


  In this simple implementation:

  - You provide the configured session if you want to, or a basic session is created.

  - All kwargs received by "send" are sent to session.request directly'
constructor:
  syntax: RequestsTransport(**kwargs)
  parameters:
  - name: session
    description: Request session to use instead of the default one.
    types:
    - <xref:requests.Session>
  - name: session_owner
    description: Decide if the session provided by user is owned by this transport.
      Default to True.
    types:
    - <xref:bool>
  - name: use_env_settings
    description: Uses proxy settings from environment. Defaults to True.
    types:
    - <xref:bool>
