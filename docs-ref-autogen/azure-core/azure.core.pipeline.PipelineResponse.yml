summary: 'A pipeline response object.


  The PipelineResponse interface exposes an HTTP response object as it returns through
  the pipeline of Policy objects.

  This ensures that Policy objects have access to the HTTP response.


  This also has a "context" object where policy can put additional fields.

  Policy SHOULD update the "context" with additional post-processed field if they
  create them.

  However, nothing prevents a policy to actually sub-class this class a return it
  instead of the initial instance.'
