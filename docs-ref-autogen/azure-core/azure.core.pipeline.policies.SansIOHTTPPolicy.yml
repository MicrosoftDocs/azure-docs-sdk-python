summary: 'Represents a sans I/O policy.


  SansIOHTTPPolicy is a base class for policies that only modify or

  mutate a request based on the HTTP specification, and do not depend

  on the specifics of any particular transport. SansIOHTTPPolicy

  subclasses will function in either a Pipeline or an AsyncPipeline,

  and can act either before the request is done, or after.

  You can optionally make these methods coroutines (or return awaitable objects)

  but they will then be tied to AsyncPipeline usage.'

    Developer can optionally implement this method to return True

    if the exception has been handled and should not be forwarded to the caller.


    This method is executed inside the exception handler.'
