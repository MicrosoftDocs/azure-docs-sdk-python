  parameters:
  - name: language
    description: The BCP-47 language code of the text in the image.
    isRequired: true
    types:
    - <xref:str>
  - name: text_angle
    description: 'The angle, in radians, of the detected text with

      respect to the closest horizontal or vertical direction. After rotating

      the input image clockwise by this angle, the recognized text lines become

      horizontal or vertical. In combination with the orientation property it

      can be used to overlay recognition results correctly on the original

      image, by rotating either the original image or recognition results by a

      suitable angle around the center of the original image. If the angle

      cannot be confidently detected, this property is not present. If the image

      contains text at different angles, only part of the text will be

      recognized correctly.'
    isRequired: true
    types:
    - <xref:float>
  - name: orientation
    description: 'Orientation of the text recognized in the image, if

      requested. The value (up, down, left, or right) refers to the direction

      that the top of the recognized text is facing, after the image has been

      rotated around its center according to the detected text angle (see

      textAngle property).

      If detection of the orientation was not requested, or no text is detected,

      the value is ''NotDetected''.'
