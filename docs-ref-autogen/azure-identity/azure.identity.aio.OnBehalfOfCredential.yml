summary: 'Authenticates a service principal via the on-behalf-of flow.


  This flow is typically used by middle-tier services that authorize requests to other
  services with a delegated

  user identity. Because this is not an interactive authentication flow, an application
  using it must have admin

  consent for any delegated permissions before requesting tokens for them. See [Azure
  Active Directory documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow)
  for a more detailed

  description of the on-behalf-of flow.'
