summary: 'Authenticates a service principal via the on-behalf-of flow.


  This flow is typically used by middle-tier services that authorize requests to other
  services with a delegated

  user identity. Because this is not an interactive authentication flow, an application
  using it must have admin

  consent for any delegated permissions before requesting tokens for them. See [Azure
  Active Directory documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow)
  for a more detailed

  description of the on-behalf-of flow.'

    description: 'Determines whether or not instance discovery is performed when attempting

      to authenticate. Setting this to true will completely disable both instance
      discovery and authority validation.

      This functionality is intended for use in scenarios where the metadata endpoint
      cannot be reached, such as in

      private clouds or Azure Stack. The process of instance discovery entails retrieving
      authority metadata from

      [https://login.microsoft.com/](https://login.microsoft.com/) to validate the
      authority. By setting this to **True**, the validation of the

      authority is disabled. As a result, it is crucial to ensure that the configured
      authority host is valid and

      trustworthy.'
