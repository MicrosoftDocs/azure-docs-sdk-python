summary: 'Authenticates users through the device code flow.


  When <xref:azure.identity.get_token> is called, this credential acquires a verification
  URL and code from Azure Active Directory.

  A user must browse to the URL, enter the code, and authenticate with Azure Active
  Directory. If the user

  authenticates successfully, the credential receives an access token.


  This credential is primarily useful for authenticating a user in an environment
  without a web browser, such as an

  SSH session. If a web browser is available, <xref:azure.identity.InteractiveBrowserCredential>
  is more

  convenient because it automatically opens a browser to the login page.'

      discovery and authority validation.

      This functionality is intended for use in scenarios where the metadata endpoint
      cannot be reached, such as in

      private clouds or Azure Stack. The process of instance discovery entails retrieving
      authority metadata from

      [https://login.microsoft.com/](https://login.microsoft.com/) to validate the
      authority. By setting this to **True**, the validation of the

      authority is disabled. As a result, it is crucial to ensure that the configured
      authority host is valid and

      trustworthy.'
