  summary: 'Authenticates users through the device code flow.


    When <xref:azure.identity.DeviceCodeCredential.get_token> is called, this credential
    acquires a verification URL and code from Azure Active Directory.

    A user must browse to the URL, enter the code, and authenticate with Azure Active
    Directory. If the user

    authenticates successfully, the credential receives an access token.


    This credential doesn''t cache tokens--each <xref:azure.identity.DeviceCodeCredential.get_token>
    call begins a new authentication flow.
