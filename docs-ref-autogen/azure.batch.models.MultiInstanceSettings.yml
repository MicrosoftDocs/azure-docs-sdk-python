  summary: 'Bases: `msrest.serialization.Model`

    Settings which specify how to run a multi-instance task.

    Multi-instance tasks are commonly used to support MPI tasks.'
  syntax:
    content: MultiInstanceSettings(self, number_of_instances, coordination_command_line=None,
      common_resource_files=None)
    parameters:
    - description: The number of compute nodes required by the task.
      id: number_of_instances
      type:
      - int
    - description: The command line to run on all the compute nodes to enable them
        to coordinate when the primary runs the main task command. A typical coordination
        command line launches a background service and verifies that the service is
        ready to process inter-node messages.
      id: coordination_command_line
      type:
      - str
    - description: A list of files that the Batch service will download before running
        the coordination command line. The difference between common resource files
        and task resource files is that common resource files are downloaded for all
        subtasks including the primary, whereas task resource files are downloaded
        only for the primary.
