  summary: "The status of the job.\n\nCommon values returned include \"Running\",\
    \ \"Completed\", and \"Failed\". All possible values are:\n\n   * NotStarted -\
    \ This is a temporary state that client-side Run objects are in before cloud submission.\
    \ \n\n   * Starting - The Run has started being processed in the cloud. The caller\
    \ has a run ID at this point. \n\n   * Provisioning - On-demand compute is being\
    \ created for a given job submission. \n\n   * Preparing - The run environment\
    \ is being prepared and is in one of two stages:\n\n        * Docker image build\
    \ \n\n        * conda environment setup \n\n   * Queued - The job is queued on\
    \ the compute target. For example, in BatchAI, the job is in a queued state\n\n\
    \        while waiting for all the requested nodes to be ready.\n\n   * Running\
    \ - The job has started to run on the compute target. \n\n   * Finalizing - User\
    \ code execution has completed, and the run is in post-processing stages. \n\n\
    \   * CancelRequested - Cancellation has been requested for the job. \n\n   *\
    \ Completed - The run has completed successfully. This includes both the user\
    \ code execution and run\n\n        post-processing stages.\n\n   * Failed - The\
    \ run failed. Usually the Error property on a run will provide details as to why.\
    \ \n\n   * Canceled - Follows a cancellation request and indicates that the run\
    \ is now successfully cancelled. \n\n   * NotResponding - For runs that have Heartbeats\
    \ enabled, no heartbeat has been recently sent."
