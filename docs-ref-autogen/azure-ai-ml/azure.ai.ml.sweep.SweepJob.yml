    \ created for a given job submission. \n\n   * Preparing - The run environment\
    \ is being prepared and is in one of two stages:\n\n        * Docker image build\
    \ \n\n        * conda environment setup \n\n   * Queued - The job is queued on\
    \ the compute target. For example, in BatchAI, the job is in a queued state\n\n\
    \        while waiting for all the requested nodes to be ready.\n\n   * Running\
