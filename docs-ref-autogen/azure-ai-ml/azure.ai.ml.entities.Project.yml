  A Project is a lightweight object for orchestrating AI applications, and is parented
  by a hub.

  Unlike a standard workspace, a project does not have a variety of sub-resources
  directly associated with it.

  Instead, its parent hub managed these resources, which are then used by the project
  and its siblings.


  As a type of workspace, project management is controlled by an MLClient''s workspace
  operations.'
