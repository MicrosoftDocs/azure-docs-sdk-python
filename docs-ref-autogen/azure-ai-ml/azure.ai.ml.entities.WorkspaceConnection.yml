  Azure ML workspace connection provides a secure way to store authentication and
  configuration information needed

  to connect and interact with the external resources.

  respective subclasses

  (ex: ~azure.ai.ml.entities.OpenAIWorkspaceConnection) instead of instantiating this
  class directly.'
