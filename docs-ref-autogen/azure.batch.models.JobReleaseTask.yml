  summary: 'A Job Release task to run on job completion on any compute node where
    the

    job has run.


    The Job Release task runs when the job ends, because of one of the

    following: The user calls the Terminate Job API, or the Delete Job API

    while the job is still active, the job''s maximum wall clock time constraint

    is reached, and the job is still active, or the job''s Job Manager task

    completed, and the job is configured to terminate when the Job Manager

    completes. The Job Release task runs on each compute node where tasks of

    the job have run and the Job Preparation task ran and completed. If you

    reimage a compute node after it has run the Job Preparation task, and the

    job ends without any further tasks of the job running on that compute node

    (and hence the Job Preparation task does not re-run), then the Job Release

    task does not run on that node. If a compute node reboots while the Job

    Release task is still running, the Job Release task runs again when the

    compute node starts up. The job is not marked as complete until all Job

    Release tasks have completed. The Job Release task runs in the background.

    It does not occupy a scheduling slot; that is, it does not count towards

    the maxTasksPerNode limit specified on the pool.
