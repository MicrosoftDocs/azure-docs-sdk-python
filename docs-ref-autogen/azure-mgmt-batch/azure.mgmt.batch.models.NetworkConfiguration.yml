- description: 'The virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as
    the Azure

    Batch account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses to accommodate
    the

    number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet doesn''t have enough free IP addresses,
    the pool will

    partially allocate compute nodes and a resize error will occur. The ''MicrosoftAzureBatch''

    service principal must have the ''Classic Virtual Machine Contributor'' Role-Based
    Access Control

    (RBAC) role for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow communication
    from the

    Azure Batch service to be able to schedule tasks on the compute nodes. This can
    be verified by

    checking if the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG).
    If

    communication to the compute nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG,
    then the Batch

    service will set the state of the compute nodes to unusable. If the specified
    VNet has any

    associated Network Security Groups (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must
    be enabled for

    inbound communication. For pools created with a virtual machine configuration,
    enable ports

    29876 and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux and port 3389 for Windows. For pools
    created with

    a cloud service configuration, enable ports 10100, 20100, and 30100. Also enable
    outbound

    connections to Azure Storage on port 443. For cloudServiceConfiguration pools,
    only ''classic''

    VNETs are supported. For more details see:
