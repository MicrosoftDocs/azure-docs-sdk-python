      can be verified by

      checking if the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG).
      If

      communication to the compute nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG,

      enable ports

      29876 and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux and port 3389 for Windows. For
      pools created with

      a cloud service configuration, enable ports 10100, 20100, and 30100. Also enable
      outbound

      connections to Azure Storage on port 443. For cloudServiceConfiguration pools,
      only ''classic''

      VNETs are supported. For more details see:
