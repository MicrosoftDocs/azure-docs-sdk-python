      addresses, the pool

      will partially allocate compute nodes and a resize error will occur. The ''MicrosoftAzureBatch''

      Access Control

      (RBAC) role for the specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow communication
      from the

      Azure Batch service to be able to schedule tasks on the compute nodes. This
      can be verified by

      checking if the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG).
      If

      communication to the compute nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG,
      then the Batch

      service will set the state of the compute nodes to unusable. If the specified
      VNet has any

      associated Network Security Groups (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must
      be enabled for

      inbound communication. For pools created with a virtual machine configuration,
      enable ports

      29876 and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux and port 3389 for Windows. For
      pools created with

      a cloud service configuration, enable ports 10100, 20100, and 30100. Also enable
      outbound

      connections to Azure Storage on port 443. For cloudServiceConfiguration pools,
      only ''classic''

      VNETs are supported. For more details see:
