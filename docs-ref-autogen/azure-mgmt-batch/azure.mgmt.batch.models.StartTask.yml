summary: In some cases the start task may be re-run even though the node was not rebooted.
  Due to this, start tasks should be idempotent and exit gracefully if the setup they're
  performing has already been done. Special care should be taken to avoid start tasks
  which create breakaway process or install/launch services from the start task working
  directory, as this will block Batch from being able to re-run the start task.
