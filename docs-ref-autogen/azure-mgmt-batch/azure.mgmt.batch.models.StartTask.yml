summary: 'In some cases the start task may be re-run even though the node was not
  rebooted. Due to this,

  start tasks should be idempotent and exit gracefully if the setup they''re performing
  has

  already been done. Special care should be taken to avoid start tasks which create
  breakaway

  process or install/launch services from the start task working directory, as this
  will block

  Batch from being able to re-run the start task.'
