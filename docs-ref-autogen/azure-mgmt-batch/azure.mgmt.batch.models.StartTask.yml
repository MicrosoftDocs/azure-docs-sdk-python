  summary: 'A task which is run when a compute node joins a pool in the Azure Batch

    service, or when the compute node is rebooted or reimaged.


    In some cases the start task may be re-run even though the node was not

    rebooted. Due to this, start tasks should be idempotent and exit gracefully

    if the setup they''re performing has already been done. Special care should

    be taken to avoid start tasks which create breakaway process or

    install/launch services from the start task working directory, as this will

    block Batch from being able to re-run the start task.'

        For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the task up to 4

        times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0,

        the Batch service does not retry the task. If the maximum retry count is

        completed successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the

        compute node unusable, and will not schedule tasks to it. This condition

        can be detected via the node state and scheduling error detail. If false,

        the Batch service will not wait for the start task to complete. In this
