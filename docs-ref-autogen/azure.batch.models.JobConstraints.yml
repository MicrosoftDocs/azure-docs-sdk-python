        retried. The Batch service retries a task if its exit code is nonzero.

        Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The

        Batch service will try each task once, and may then retry up to this

        limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries a task up

        to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is

        0, the Batch service does not retry tasks. If the maximum retry count is

        -1, the Batch service retries tasks without limit. The default value is 0

        (no retries).
