summary: 'A batch of events.

  Sending events in a batch is more performant than sending individual events.

  EventDataBatch helps you create the maximum allowed size batch of *EventData* to
  improve sending performance.

  Use the *add* method to add events until the maximum batch size limit in bytes has
  been reached -

  at which point a *ValueError* will be raised.

  Use the *send_batch* method of <xref:azure.eventhub.EventHubProducerClient>

  or the async <xref:azure.eventhub.aio.EventHubProducerClient>

  for sending.

  **Please use the create_batch method of EventHubProducerClient

  to create an EventDataBatch object instead of instantiating an EventDataBatch object
  directly.**

  **WARNING: Updating the value of the instance variable max_size_in_bytes on an instantiated
  EventDataBatch object

  is HIGHLY DISCOURAGED. The updated max_size_in_bytes value may conflict with the
  maximum size of events allowed

  by the Event Hubs service and result in a sending failure.**'
