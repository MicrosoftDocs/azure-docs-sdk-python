        \ IMPORTANT: Although\noptional, you should consider this header required.\
        \ Persisting the\nclient ID across multiple requests for the same end user\

        longitudes. re (required): The radius, in meters, which specifies the

        horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the value returned by the

        device''s location service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi,

        380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup.

        1, 1970.) head (optional): The client''s relative heading or direction

        of travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through

        360, counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only

        if the sp key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity

        alt (optional): The altitude of the client device, in meters. are

        that you provide, the more accurate the location results are. Although

        location. Providing the location is especially important if the

        client''s IP address does not accurately reflect the user''s physical
