    The first part, matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value}
    in the

    matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field
    is ''key'', the

    operator is ''In'', and the values array contains only ''value''. The second part,
    matchExpressions

    is a list of resource selector requirements. Valid operators include In, NotIn,
    Exists, and

    DoesNotExist. The values set must be non-empty in the case of In and NotIn. The
    values set must

    be empty in the case of Exists and DoesNotExist. All of the requirements, from
    both matchLabels

    and matchExpressions must all be satisfied in order to match.'
