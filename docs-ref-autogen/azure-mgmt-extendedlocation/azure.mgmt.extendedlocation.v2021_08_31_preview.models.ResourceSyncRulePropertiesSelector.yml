summary: A label selector is composed of two parts, matchLabels and matchExpressions.
  The first part, matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value}
  in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key
  field is 'key', the operator is 'In', and the values array contains only 'value'.
  The second part, matchExpressions is a list of resource selector requirements. Valid
  operators include In, NotIn, Exists, and DoesNotExist. The values set must be non-empty
  in the case of In and NotIn. The values set must be empty in the case of Exists
  and DoesNotExist. All of the requirements, from both matchLabels and matchExpressions
  must all be satisfied in order to match.

  syntax: 'ResourceSyncRulePropertiesSelector(*, match_expressions: Optional[List[_models.MatchExpressionsProperties]]
