  summary: 'A message receiver.


    This receive handler acts as an iterable message stream for retrieving

    messages for a Service Bus entity. It operates a single connection that must be
    opened and

    closed on completion. The service connection will remain open for the entirety
    of the iterator.

    If you find yourself only partially iterating the message stream, you should run
    the receiver

    in a *with* statement to ensure the connection is closed.

    The Receiver should not be instantiated directly, and should be accessed from
    a *QueueClient* or

    *SubscriptionClient* using the *get_receiver()* method.
