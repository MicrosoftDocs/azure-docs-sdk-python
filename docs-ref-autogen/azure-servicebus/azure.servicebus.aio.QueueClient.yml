  summary: 'A queue client.


    The QueueClient class defines a high level interface for sending

    messages to and receiving messages from an Azure Service Bus queue.

    If you do not wish to perform management operations, a QueueClient can be

    instantiated directly to perform send and receive operations to a Queue.

    However if a QueueClient is created directly, a *get_properties* operation will

    need to be completed in order to retrieve the properties of this queue (for example,

    whether it is sessionful).'
