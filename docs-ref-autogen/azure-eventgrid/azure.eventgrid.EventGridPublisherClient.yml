    A single instance or a list of dictionaries, CloudEvents or EventGridEvents are

    EventGridEvent(s) apart from the strongly typed objects.


    When publishing a Custom Schema Event(s), dict-like representation is accepted.

    Either a single dictionary or a list of dictionaries can be passed.

    and sending each event

    will not result in optimal performance. For best performance, it is highly recommended
