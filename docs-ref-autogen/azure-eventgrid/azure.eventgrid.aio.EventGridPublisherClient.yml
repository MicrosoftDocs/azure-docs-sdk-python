    A single instance or a list of dictionaries, CloudEvents or EventGridEvents are
    accepted.


    Dict representation of respective serialized models is accepted as CloudEvent(s)
    or

    EventGridEvent(s) apart from the strongly typed objects.


    When publishing a Custom Schema Event(s), dict-like representation is accepted.

    Either a single dictionary or a list of dictionaries can be passed.


    **WARNING**: When sending a list of multiple events at one time, iterating over
    and sending each event

    will not result in optimal performance. For best performance, it is highly recommended
    to send

    a list of events.'
