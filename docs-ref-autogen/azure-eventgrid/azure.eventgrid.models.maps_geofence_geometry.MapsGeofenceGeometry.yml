summary: The geofence geometry.
constructor:
  syntax: MapsGeofenceGeometry(**kwargs)
  parameters:
  - name: device_id
    description: ID of the device.
    types:
    - <xref:str>
  - name: distance
    description: 'Distance from the coordinate to the closest border of the

      geofence. Positive means the coordinate is outside of the geofence. If the

      coordinate is outside of the geofence, but more than the value of

      searchBuffer away from the closest geofence border, then the value is 999.

      Negative means the coordinate is inside of the geofence. If the coordinate

      is inside the polygon, but more than the value of searchBuffer away from

      the closest geofencing border,then the value is -999. A value of 999 means

      that there is great confidence the coordinate is well outside the

      geofence. A value of -999 means that there is great confidence the

      coordinate is well within the geofence.'
