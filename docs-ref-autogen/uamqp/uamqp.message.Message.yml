summary: 'An AMQP message.


  When sending, if body type information is not provided,

  then depending on the nature of the data,

  different body encoding will be used. If the data is str or bytes,

  a single part DataBody will be sent. If the data is a list of str/bytes,

  a multipart DataBody will be sent. Any other type of list or any other

  type of data will be sent as a ValueBody.

  An empty payload will also be sent as a ValueBody.

  If body type information is provided, then the Message will use the given

  body type to encode the data or raise error if the data doesn''t match the body
  type.'
