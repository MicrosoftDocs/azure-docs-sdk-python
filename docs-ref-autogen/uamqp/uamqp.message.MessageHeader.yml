    this message. If this value is non-zero it can be taken as an indication that

    be discarded

    (or dead lettered). When a message is transmitted by an intermediary that was
    received

    with a ttl, the transmitted message''s header SHOULD contain a ttl that is computed
    as the

    difference between the current time and the formerly computed message expiration
    time,

    i.e., the reduced ttl, so that messages will eventually die if they end up in
    a delivery loop.'
