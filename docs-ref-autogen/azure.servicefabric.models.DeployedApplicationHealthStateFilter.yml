  summary: 'Defines matching criteria to determine whether a deployed application

    should be included as a child of an application in the cluster health

    chunk.

    The deployed applications are only returned if the parent application

    matches a filter specified in the cluster health chunk query description.

    One filter can match zero, one or multiple deployed applications, depending

    on its properties.

    - description: 'The name of the node where the application is

        deployed in order to match the filter.

        If specified, the filter is applied only to the application deployed on

        the specified node.

        If the application is not deployed on the node with the specified name, no

        deployed application is returned in the cluster health chunk based on this

        filter.

        Otherwise, the deployed application is included in the cluster health

        chunk if it respects the other filter properties.

        If not specified, all deployed applications that match the parent filters

        (if any) are taken into consideration and matched against the other filter

        members, like health state filter.

    - description: 'The filter for the health state of the

        deployed applications. It allows selecting deployed applications if they

        match the desired health states.

        The possible values are integer value of one of the following health

        states. Only deployed applications that match the filter are returned. All

        deployed applications are used to evaluate the cluster aggregated health

        state.

        If not specified, default value is None, unless the node name is

        specified. If the filter has default value and node name is specified, the

        matching deployed application is returned.

        The state values are flag based enumeration, so the value could be a

        combination of these values obtained using bitwise ''OR'' operator.

        For example, if the provided value is 6, it matches deployed applications

        with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4).

        - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.

        - None - Filter that doesn''t match any HealthState value. Used in order to

        return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.

        - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is

        2.

        - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The

        value is 4.

        - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The

        value is 8.

        - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is

        65535.

        The deployed application filter may specify multiple deployed service

        package filters.

        For example, it can specify a filter to return all deployed service

        packages with health state Error and another filter to always include a

        deployed service package on a node.
