        The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of deployed

        applications that can be unhealthy before the application is considered in

        error.

        This is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy deployed

        applications over the number of nodes where the application is currently

        deployed on in the cluster.

        The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of

        nodes. Default percentage is zero.
