    when re-issuing a request. For example, you should use the same task

    IDs during a retry so that if the prior operation succeeded, the retry

    will not create extra tasks unexpectedly. If the response contains any

    tasks which failed to add, a client can retry the request. In a retry,

    it is most efficient to resubmit only tasks that failed to add, and to

    omit tasks that were successfully added on the first attempt. The

    maximum lifetime of a task from addition to completion is 180 days.
