summary: 'A Job Release Task to run on Job completion on any Compute Node where the

  Job has run.


  The Job Release Task runs when the Job ends, because of one of the

  following: The user calls the Terminate Job API, or the Delete Job API

  while the Job is still active, the Job''s maximum wall clock time constraint

  is reached, and the Job is still active, or the Job''s Job Manager Task

  completed, and the Job is configured to terminate when the Job Manager

  completes. The Job Release Task runs on each Node where Tasks of the Job

  have run and the Job Preparation Task ran and completed. If you reimage a

  Node after it has run the Job Preparation Task, and the Job ends without

  any further Tasks of the Job running on that Node (and hence the Job

  Preparation Task does not re-run), then the Job Release Task does not run

  on that Compute Node. If a Node reboots while the Job Release Task is still

  running, the Job Release Task runs again when the Compute Node starts up.

  The Job is not marked as complete until all Job Release Tasks have

  completed. The Job Release Task runs in the background. It does not occupy

  a scheduling slot; that is, it does not count towards the taskSlotsPerNode

  limit specified on the Pool.


  All required parameters must be populated in order to send to Azure.'
