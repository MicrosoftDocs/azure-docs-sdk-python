  summary: 'Specifies details of a Job Manager Task.


    The Job Manager Task is automatically started when the Job is created. The

    Batch service tries to schedule the Job Manager Task before any other Tasks

    in the Job. When shrinking a Pool, the Batch service tries to preserve

    Nodes where Job Manager Tasks are running for as long as possible (that is,

    Compute Nodes running ''normal'' Tasks are removed before Compute Nodes

    running Job Manager Tasks). When a Job Manager Task fails and needs to be

    restarted, the system tries to schedule it at the highest priority. If

    there are no idle Compute Nodes available, the system may terminate one of

    the running Tasks in the Pool and return it to the queue in order to make

    room for the Job Manager Task to restart. Note that a Job Manager Task in

    one Job does not have priority over Tasks in other Jobs. Across Jobs, only

    Job level priorities are observed. For example, if a Job Manager in a

    priority 0 Job needs to be restarted, it will not displace Tasks of a

    priority 1 Job. Batch will retry Tasks when a recovery operation is

    triggered on a Node. Examples of recovery operations include (but are not

    limited to) when an unhealthy Node is rebooted or a Compute Node

    disappeared due to host failure. Retries due to recovery operations are

    independent of and are not counted against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if

    the maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an internal retry due to a recovery operation

    may occur. Because of this, all Tasks should be idempotent. This means

    Tasks need to tolerate being interrupted and restarted without causing any

    corruption or duplicate data. The best practice for long running Tasks is

    to use some form of checkpointing.
