        -1000 to 1000, with -1000 being the lowest priority and 1000 being the

        termination, you cannot turn it off again. If you try to do this, the

        request fails with an ''invalid property value'' error response; if you are

        calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).

        in the poolInfo, only the keepAlive property can be updated, and then only
