summary: The set of changes to be made to a Job.

    constraints=None, pool_info=None, metadata=None, **kwargs) -> None'
  parameters:
  - name: priority
    description: 'The priority of the Job. Priority values can range from

      -1000 to 1000, with -1000 being the lowest priority and 1000 being the

      highest priority. If omitted, the priority of the Job is left unchanged.'
    types:
    - <xref:int>
  - name: on_all_tasks_complete
    description: 'The action the Batch service should take

      when all Tasks in the Job are in the completed state. If omitted, the

      completion behavior is left unchanged. You may not change the value from

      terminatejob to noaction - that is, once you have engaged automatic Job

      termination, you cannot turn it off again. If you try to do this, the

      request fails with an ''invalid property value'' error response; if you are

      calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad Request).

      Possible values include: ''noAction'', ''terminateJob'''

  - name: pool_info
    description: 'The Pool on which the Batch service runs the Job''s

      Tasks. You may change the Pool for a Job only when the Job is disabled.

      The Patch Job call will fail if you include the poolInfo element and the

      Job is not disabled. If you specify an autoPoolSpecification in the

      poolInfo, only the keepAlive property of the autoPoolSpecification can be

      updated, and then only if the autoPoolSpecification has a

      poolLifetimeOption of Job (other job properties can be updated as normal).

      If omitted, the Job continues to run on its current Pool.'

    description: 'A list of name-value pairs associated with the Job as

      metadata. If omitted, the existing Job metadata is left unchanged.'
