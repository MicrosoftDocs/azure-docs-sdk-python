    The Batch service supports two ways to control the work done as part of

    a Job. In the first approach, the user specifies a Job Manager Task.

    The Batch service launches this Task when it is ready to start the Job.

    The Job Manager Task controls all other Tasks that run under this Job,

    by using the Task APIs. In the second approach, the user directly

    controls the execution of Tasks under an active Job, by using the Task

    APIs. Also note: when naming Jobs, avoid including sensitive

    information such as user names or secret project names. This

    information may appear in telemetry logs accessible to Microsoft

    Support engineers.'
