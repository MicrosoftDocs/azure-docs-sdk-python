    - description: 'The ARM resource identifier of the virtual network

        subnet which the compute nodes of the pool will join. This is of the form

        /subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{group}/providers/{provider}/virtualNetworks/{network}/subnets/{subnet}.

        The virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the

        Azure Batch account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP

        addresses to accommodate the number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet

        doesn''t have enough free IP addresses, the pool will partially allocate

        compute nodes, and a resize error will occur. For pools created with

        virtualMachineConfiguration only ARM virtual networks

        (''Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks'') are supported, but for pools created

        with cloudServiceConfiguration both ARM and classic virtual networks are

        supported. For more details, see:
