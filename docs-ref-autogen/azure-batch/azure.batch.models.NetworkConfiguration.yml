  summary: The network configuration for a Pool.
  syntax:
    content: 'NetworkConfiguration(*, subnet_id: str = None, dynamic_vnet_assignment_scope=None,
      endpoint_configuration=None, public_ip_address_configuration=None, **kwargs)
      -> None'
    parameters:
    - description: 'The ARM resource identifier of the virtual network

        subnet which the Compute Nodes of the Pool will join. This is of the form

        /subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{group}/providers/{provider}/virtualNetworks/{network}/subnets/{subnet}.

        The virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the

        Azure Batch Account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP

        addresses to accommodate the number of Compute Nodes in the Pool. If the

        subnet doesn''t have enough free IP addresses, the Pool will partially

        allocate Nodes and a resize error will occur. The ''MicrosoftAzureBatch''

        service principal must have the ''Classic Virtual Machine Contributor''

        Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet. The

        specified subnet must allow communication from the Azure Batch service to

        be able to schedule Tasks on the Nodes. This can be verified by checking

        if the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If

        communication to the Nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG,

        then the Batch service will set the state of the Compute Nodes to

        unusable. For Pools created with virtualMachineConfiguration only ARM

        virtual networks (''Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks'') are supported, but

        for Pools created with cloudServiceConfiguration both ARM and classic

        virtual networks are supported. If the specified VNet has any associated

        Network Security Groups (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must be

        enabled for inbound communication. For Pools created with a virtual

        machine configuration, enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as port 22

        for Linux and port 3389 for Windows. For Pools created with a cloud

        service configuration, enable ports 10100, 20100, and 30100. Also enable

        outbound connections to Azure Storage on port 443. For more details see:
