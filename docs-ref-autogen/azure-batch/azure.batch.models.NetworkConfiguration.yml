summary: The network configuration for a Pool.

    endpoint_configuration=None, public_ip_address_configuration=None, **kwargs) ->
    None'
  parameters:
  - name: subnet_id
    description: 'The virtual network must be in the same region and

      subscription as the Azure Batch Account. The specified subnet should have

      enough free IP addresses to accommodate the number of Compute Nodes in the

      Pool. If the subnet doesn''t have enough free IP addresses, the Pool will

      partially allocate Nodes and a resize error will occur. The

      ''MicrosoftAzureBatch'' service principal must have the ''Classic Virtual

      Machine Contributor'' Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) role for the

      specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow communication from the

      Azure Batch service to be able to schedule Tasks on the Nodes. This can be

      verified by checking if the specified VNet has any associated Network

      Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the Nodes in the specified

      subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch service will set the state of

      the Compute Nodes to unusable. For Pools created with

      virtualMachineConfiguration only ARM virtual networks

      (''Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks'') are supported, but for Pools created

      with cloudServiceConfiguration both ARM and classic virtual networks are

      supported. If the specified VNet has any associated Network Security

      Groups (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound

      communication. For Pools created with a virtual machine configuration,

      enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux and port 3389

      for Windows. For Pools created with a cloud service configuration, enable

      ports 10100, 20100, and 30100. Also enable outbound connections to Azure

      Storage on port 443. For more details see:
