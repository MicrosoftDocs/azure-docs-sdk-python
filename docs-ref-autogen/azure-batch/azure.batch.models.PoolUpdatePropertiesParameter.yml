      collection, any existing Certificate references are removed from the Pool.

      For Windows Nodes, the Batch service installs the Certificates to the

      specified Certificate store and location. For Linux Compute Nodes, the

      Certificates are stored in a directory inside the Task working directory

      and an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the

      Task to query for this location. For Certificates with visibility of

      ''remoteUser'', a ''certs'' directory is created in the user''s home directory

      (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and Certificates are placed in that

      directory.'
