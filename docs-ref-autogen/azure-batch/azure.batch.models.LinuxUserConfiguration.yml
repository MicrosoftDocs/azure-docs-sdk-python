      The private key is used to automatically configure asymmetric-key based

      authentication for SSH between Compute Nodes in a Linux Pool when the

      Pool''s enableInterNodeCommunication property is true (it is ignored if

      enableInterNodeCommunication is false). It does this by placing the key

      pair into the user''s .ssh directory. If not specified, password-less SSH

      is not configured between Compute Nodes (no modification of the user''s

      .ssh directory is done).'
