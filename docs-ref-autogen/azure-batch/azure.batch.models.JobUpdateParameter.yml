  - name: pool_info
    description: 'Required. The Pool on which the Batch service runs the

      Job''s Tasks. You may change the Pool for a Job only when the Job is

      disabled. The Update Job call will fail if you include the poolInfo

      element and the Job is not disabled. If you specify an

      autoPoolSpecification in the poolInfo, only the keepAlive property of the

      autoPoolSpecification can be updated, and then only if the

      autoPoolSpecification has a poolLifetimeOption of Job (other job

      properties can be updated as normal).'

    description: 'The action the Batch service should take

      when all Tasks in the Job are in the completed state. If omitted, the

      completion behavior is set to noaction. If the current value is

      terminatejob, this is an error because a Job''s completion behavior may not

      be changed from terminatejob to noaction. You may not change the value

      from terminatejob to noaction - that is, once you have engaged automatic

      Job termination, you cannot turn it off again. If you try to do this, the

      request fails and Batch returns status code 400 (Bad Request) and an

      ''invalid property value'' error response. If you do not specify this

      element in a PUT request, it is equivalent to passing noaction. This is an

      error if the current value is terminatejob. Possible values include:

      ''noAction'', ''terminateJob'''
