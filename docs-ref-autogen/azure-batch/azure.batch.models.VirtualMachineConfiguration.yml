      Node agent is a program that runs on each Compute Node in the Pool, and

      provides the command-and-control interface between the Compute Node and

      the Batch service. There are different implementations of the Compute Node

      agent, known as SKUs, for different operating systems. You must specify a

      Compute Node agent SKU which matches the selected Image reference. To get

      the list of supported Compute Node agent SKUs along with their list of

      verified Image references, see the ''List supported Compute Node agent

      SKUs'' operation.'

      file share). Existing disks cannot be attached, each attached disk is

      empty. When the Compute Node is removed from the Pool, the disk and all

      data associated with it is also deleted. The disk is not formatted after

      being attached, it must be formatted before use - for more information see
