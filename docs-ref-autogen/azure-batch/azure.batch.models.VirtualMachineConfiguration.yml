        program that runs on each node in the pool, and provides the

        command-and-control interface between the node and the Batch service.

        There are different implementations of the node agent, known as SKUs, for

        different operating systems. You must specify a node agent SKU which

        matches the selected image reference. To get the list of supported node

        agent SKUs along with their list of verified image references, see the

        ''List supported node agent SKUs'' operation.

        cannot be updated. Each node gets its own disk (the disk is not a file

        share). Existing disks cannot be attached, each attached disk is empty.

        When the node is removed from the pool, the disk and all data associated

        with it is also deleted. The disk is not formatted after being attached,

        it must be formatted before use - for more information see
