summary: 'An Azure Batch Task.


  Batch will retry Tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a Node.

  Examples of recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an

  unhealthy Node is rebooted or a Compute Node disappeared due to host

  failure. Retries due to recovery operations are independent of and are not

  counted against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount is 0,

  an internal retry due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of this,

  all Tasks should be idempotent. This means Tasks need to tolerate being

  interrupted and restarted without causing any corruption or duplicate data.

  The best practice for long running Tasks is to use some form of

  checkpointing.'
