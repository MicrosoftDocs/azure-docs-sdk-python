      existing Certificate references are left unchanged. For Windows Nodes, the

      Batch service installs the Certificates to the specified Certificate store

      and location. For Linux Compute Nodes, the Certificates are stored in a

      directory inside the Task working directory and an environment variable

      AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the Task to query for this

      location. For Certificates with visibility of ''remoteUser'', a ''certs''

      directory is created in the user''s home directory (e.g.,
