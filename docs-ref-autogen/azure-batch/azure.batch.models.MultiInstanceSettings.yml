summary: 'Settings which specify how to run a multi-instance Task.


  Multi-instance Tasks are commonly used to support MPI Tasks. In the MPI

  case, if any of the subtasks fail (for example due to exiting with a

  non-zero exit code) the entire multi-instance Task fails. The

  multi-instance Task is then terminated and retried, up to its retry limit.


  All required parameters must be populated in order to send to Azure.'

  - name: common_resource_files
    description: 'The difference between common resource files

      and Task resource files is that common resource files are downloaded for

      all subtasks including the primary, whereas Task resource files are

      downloaded only for the primary. Also note that these resource files are

      not downloaded to the Task working directory, but instead are downloaded

      to the Task root directory (one directory above the working directory).

      There is a maximum size for the list of resource files.  When the max size

      is exceeded, the request will fail and the response error code will be

      RequestEntityTooLarge. If this occurs, the collection of ResourceFiles

      must be reduced in size. This can be achieved using .zip files,

      Application Packages, or Docker Containers.'
