summary: 'A Task which is run when a Node joins a Pool in the Azure Batch service,
  or

  when the Compute Node is rebooted or reimaged.


  Batch will retry Tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a Node.

  Examples of recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an

  unhealthy Node is rebooted or a Compute Node disappeared due to host

  failure. Retries due to recovery operations are independent of and are not

  counted against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount is 0,

  an internal retry due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of this,

  all Tasks should be idempotent. This means Tasks need to tolerate being

  interrupted and restarted without causing any corruption or duplicate data.

  The best practice for long running Tasks is to use some form of

  checkpointing. In some cases the StartTask may be re-run even though the

  Compute Node was not rebooted. Special care should be taken to avoid

  StartTasks which create breakaway process or install/launch services from

  the StartTask working directory, as this will block Batch from being able

  to re-run the StartTask.


  All required parameters must be populated in order to send to Azure.'

      Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The

      Batch service will try the Task once, and may then retry up to this limit.

      For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the Task up to 4

      times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0,

      the Batch service does not retry the Task. If the maximum retry count is

      -1, the Batch service retries the Task without limit, however this is not

      recommended for a start task or any task. The default value is 0 (no

      retry count (maxTaskRetryCount). If the Task has still not completed

      successfully after all retries, then the Batch service marks the Node

      unusable, and will not schedule Tasks to it. This condition can be

      detected via the Compute Node state and failure info details. If false,

      the Batch service will not wait for the StartTask to complete. In this

      case, other Tasks can start executing on the Compute Node while the

      StartTask is still running; and even if the StartTask fails, new Tasks

      will continue to be scheduled on the Compute Node. The default is true.'
