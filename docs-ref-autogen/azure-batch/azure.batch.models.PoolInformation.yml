      schedule a Job, no Tasks for the Job will run until you create a Pool with

      that id. Note that the Batch service will not reject the Job request; it

      will simply not run Tasks until the Pool exists. You must specify either

    description: 'Characteristics for a temporary ''auto

      pool''. The Batch service will create this auto Pool when the Job is

      submitted. If auto Pool creation fails, the Batch service moves the Job to

      a completed state, and the Pool creation error is set in the Job''s

      scheduling error property. The Batch service manages the lifetime (both

      creation and, unless keepAlive is specified, deletion) of the auto Pool.

      Any user actions that affect the lifetime of the auto Pool while the Job

      is active will result in unexpected behavior. You must specify either the

      Pool ID or the auto Pool specification, but not both.'
