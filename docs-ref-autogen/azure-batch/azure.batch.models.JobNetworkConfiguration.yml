summary: 'The network configuration for the Job.


  All required parameters must be populated in order to send to Azure.'
constructor:

  parameters:
  - name: subnet_id
    description: 'Required. The virtual network must be in the same region

      and subscription as the Azure Batch Account. The specified subnet should

      have enough free IP addresses to accommodate the number of Compute Nodes

      which will run Tasks from the Job. This can be up to the number of Compute

      Nodes in the Pool. The ''MicrosoftAzureBatch'' service principal must have

      the ''Classic Virtual Machine Contributor'' Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

      role for the specified VNet so that Azure Batch service can schedule Tasks

      on the Nodes. This can be verified by checking if the specified VNet has

      any associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the

      Nodes in the specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch service

      will set the state of the Compute Nodes to unusable. This is of the form

      /subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{group}/providers/{provider}/virtualNetworks/{network}/subnets/{subnet}.

      If the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG),

      then a few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound communication

      from the Azure Batch service. For Pools created with a Virtual Machine

      configuration, enable ports 29876 and 29877, as well as port 22 for Linux

      and port 3389 for Windows. Port 443 is also required to be open for

      outbound connections for communications to Azure Storage. For more details
