    description: 'A label that is assigned to a JobOutput in order to help uniquely
      identify it.

      This is useful when your Transform has more than one TransformOutput, whereby
      your Job has more

      than one JobOutput. In such cases, when you submit the Job, you will add two
      or more

      JobOutputs, in the same order as TransformOutputs in the Transform. Subsequently,
      when you

      retrieve the Job, either through events or on a GET request, you can use the
      label to easily

      identify the JobOutput. If a label is not provided, a default value of

      ''{presetName}_{outputIndex}'' will be used, where the preset name is the name
      of the preset in

      the corresponding TransformOutput and the output index is the relative index
      of the this

      JobOutput within the Job. Note that this index is the same as the relative index
      of the

      corresponding TransformOutput within its Transform.'
