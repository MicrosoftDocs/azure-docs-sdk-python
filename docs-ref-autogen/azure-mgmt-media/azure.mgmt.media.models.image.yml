    a macro {Best},

    which tells the encoder to select the best thumbnail from the first few seconds

- description: 'The intervals at which thumbnails are generated. The value can be

    format (For example, PT05S for one image every 5 seconds), or a frame count (For

    10% for

    one image every 10% of stream duration). Note: Step value will affect the first
    generated

    thumbnail, which may not be exactly the one specified at transform preset start
    time. This is

    due to the encoder, which tries to select the best thumbnail between start time
    and Step

    position from start time as the first output. As the default value is 10%, it
    means if stream

    has long duration, the first generated thumbnail might be far away from the one
    specified at

    start time. Try to select reasonable value for Step if the first thumbnail is
    expected close to

    start time, or set Range value at 1 if only one thumbnail is needed at start time.'

    300 to stop

    at the 300th frame from the frame at start time. If this value is 1, it means
    only producing

    one thumbnail at start time), or a relative value to the stream duration (For
    example, 50% to

    stop at half of stream duration from start time). The default value is 100%, which
