summary: 'Describes the settings to be used when encoding the input video into a desired
  output bitrate layer.


  You probably want to use the sub-classes and not this class directly. Known

  sub-classes are: H265Layer.

  - name: width
    description: 'The width of the output video for this layer. The value can be absolute
      (in

      pixels) or relative (in percentage). For example 50% means the output video
      has half as many

  - name: height
    description: 'The height of the output video for this layer. The value can be
      absolute (in

      pixels) or relative (in percentage). For example 50% means the output video
      has half as many

      pixels in height as the input.'

      different video and audio layers, or in naming the output file.'

    - <xref:str>
  - name: bitrate
    description: 'Required. The average bitrate in bits per second at which to encode
      the input

      video when generating this layer. For example: a target bitrate of 3000Kbps
      or 3Mbps means this

      value should be 3000000 This is a required field.'

    description: 'The maximum bitrate (in bits per second), at which the VBV buffer

      assumed to refill. If not specified, defaults to the same value as bitrate.'

      the encoder chooses an appropriate number based on the video profile and level.'

    - <xref:int>

    description: 'The frame rate (in frames per second) at which to encode this layer.
      The

      value can be in the form of M/N where M and N are integers (For example, 30000/1001),
      or in the

      form of a number (For example, 30, or 29.97). The encoder enforces constraints
      on allowed frame

      rates based on the profile and level. If it is not specified, the encoder will
      use the same

      frame rate as the input video.'

  - name: slices
    description: 'The number of slices to be used when encoding this layer. If not
      specified,

      default is zero, which means that encoder will use a single slice for each frame.'

    types:
    - <xref:int>
  - name: adaptive_b_frame
    description: 'Specifies whether or not adaptive B-frames are to be used when

      the video profile

      permits its use.'
