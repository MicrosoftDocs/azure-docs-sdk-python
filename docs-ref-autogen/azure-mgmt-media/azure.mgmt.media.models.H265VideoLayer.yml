summary: 'Describes the settings to be used when encoding the input video into a desired
  output bitrate layer.

  You probably want to use the sub-classes and not this class directly. Known

  sub-classes are: H265Layer.

  All required parameters must be populated in order to send to Azure.'

  - name: width
    description: 'The width of the output video for this layer. The value can be absolute
      (in

      pixels) or relative (in percentage). For example 50% means the output video
      has half as many

    description: 'The height of the output video for this layer. The value can be

      has half as many

    description: 'Required. The average bitrate in bits per second at which to encode
      the input

      video when generating this layer. For example: a target bitrate of 3000Kbps
      or 3Mbps means this

      value should be 3000000 This is a required field.'

    description: 'The frame rate (in frames per second) at which to encode this layer.
      The

      value can be in the form of M/N where M and N are integers (For example, 30000/1001),
      or in the

      form of a number (For example, 30, or 29.97). The encoder enforces constraints
      on allowed frame

      rates based on the profile and level. If it is not specified, the encoder will

      frame rate as the input video.'

  - name: slices
    description: 'The number of slices to be used when encoding this layer. If not
      specified,

      default is zero, which means that encoder will use a single slice for each frame.'

    - <xref:int>
  - name: adaptive_b_frame
    description: 'Specifies whether or not adaptive B-frames are to be used when

      permits its use.'
