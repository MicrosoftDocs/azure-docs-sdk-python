      time. This is

      due to the encoder, which tries to select the best thumbnail between start time

      position from start time as the first output. As the default value is 10%, it
      means if stream

      has long duration, the first generated thumbnail might be far away from the
      one specified at

      start time. Try to select reasonable value for Step if the first thumbnail is

      only producing

      one thumbnail at start time), or a relative value to the stream duration (For
      example, 50% to
