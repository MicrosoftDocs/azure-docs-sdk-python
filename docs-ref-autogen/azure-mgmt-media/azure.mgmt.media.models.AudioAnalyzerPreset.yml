summary: 'The Audio Analyzer preset applies a pre-defined set of AI-based analysis
  operations, including speech transcription. Currently, the preset supports processing
  of content with a single audio track.


  You probably want to use the sub-classes and not this class directly. Known

  sub-classes are: VideoAnalyzerPreset.


  All required parameters must be populated in order to send to Azure.'

- description: 'The language for the audio payload in the input using the BCP-47 format

    of ''language tag-region'' (e.g: ''en-US'').  If you know the language of your
    content, it is

    recommended that you specify it. The language must be specified explicitly for

    AudioAnalysisMode::Basic, since automatic language detection is not included in
    basic mode. If

    the language isn''t specified or set to null, automatic language detection will
    choose the first

    language detected and process with the selected language for the duration of the
    file. It does

    not currently support dynamically switching between languages after the first
    language is

    detected. The automatic detection works best with audio recordings with clearly
    discernable

    speech. If automatic detection fails to find the language, transcription would
    fallback to

    ''en-US''." The list of supported languages is available here:
