summary: 'The Audio Analyzer preset applies a pre-defined set of AI-based analysis
  operations, including speech transcription. Currently, the preset supports processing
  of content with a single audio track.


  You probably want to use the sub-classes and not this class directly. Known sub-classes
  are:
