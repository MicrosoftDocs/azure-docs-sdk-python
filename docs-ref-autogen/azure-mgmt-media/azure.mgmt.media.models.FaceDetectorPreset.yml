  - name: resolution
    description: 'Specifies the maximum resolution at which your video is analyzed.
      The

      default behavior is "SourceResolution," which will keep the input video at its
      original

      resolution when analyzed. Using "StandardDefinition" will resize input videos
      to standard

      definition while preserving the appropriate aspect ratio. It will only resize
      if the video is

      of higher resolution. For example, a 1920x1080 input would be scaled to 640x360
      before

      processing. Switching to "StandardDefinition" will reduce the time it takes
      to process high

      resolution video. It may also reduce the cost of using this component (see

      [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/media-services/#analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/media-services/#analytics)
      for details).

      However, faces that end up being too small in the resized video may not be detected.

      values include: "SourceResolution", "StandardDefinition".'

      enables a 2-pass

      process, allowing for selective redaction of a subset of detected faces.It takes
      in the

      metadata file from a prior analyze pass, along with the source video, and a
