- description: 'Specifies the maximum resolution at which your video is analyzed.
    The default

    behavior is "SourceResolution," which will keep the input video at its original
    resolution when

    analyzed. Using "StandardDefinition" will resize input videos to standard definition
    while

    preserving the appropriate aspect ratio. It will only resize if the video is of
    higher

    resolution. For example, a 1920x1080 input would be scaled to 640x360 before processing.

    Switching to "StandardDefinition" will reduce the time it takes to process high
    resolution

    video. It may also reduce the cost of using this component (see

    [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/media-services/#analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/media-services/#analytics)
    for details).

    However, faces that end up being too small in the resized video may not be detected.
    Possible

    values include: "SourceResolution", "StandardDefinition".'

- description: 'This mode provides the ability to choose between the following settings:
    1) Analyze

    - For detection only.This mode generates a metadata JSON file marking appearances
    of faces

    throughout the video.Where possible, appearances of the same person are assigned
    the same ID.

    2) Combined - Additionally redacts(blurs) detected faces. 3) Redact - This enables
    a 2-pass

    process, allowing for selective redaction of a subset of detected faces.It takes
    in the

    metadata file from a prior analyze pass, along with the source video, and a user-selected

    subset of IDs that require redaction. Possible values include: "Analyze", "Redact",
    "Combined".'
