- description: 'Sets the interleave mode of the output to control how audio and video

    are stored in the container format. Example: set InterleavedOutput as NonInterleavedOutput

    produce audio-only and video-only outputs in separate MP4 files. Possible values

- description: 'The maximum bitrate in bits per second (threshold for the top video

    the encoding job.'
