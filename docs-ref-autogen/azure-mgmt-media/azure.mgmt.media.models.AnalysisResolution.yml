summary: 'Specifies the maximum resolution at which your video is analyzed. The default
  behavior is

  "SourceResolution," which will keep the input video at its original resolution when
  analyzed.

  Using "StandardDefinition" will resize input videos to standard definition while
  preserving the

  appropriate aspect ratio. It will only resize if the video is of higher resolution.
  For

  example, a 1920x1080 input would be scaled to 640x360 before processing. Switching
  to

  "StandardDefinition" will reduce the time it takes to process high resolution video.
  It may

  also reduce the cost of using this component (see

  [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/media-services/#analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/media-services/#analytics)
  for details).

  However, faces that end up being too small in the resized video may not be detected.'
