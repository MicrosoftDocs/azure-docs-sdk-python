    description: 'The language for the audio payload in the input using the BCP-47
      format

      of ''language tag-region'' (e.g: ''en-US'').  If you know the language of your
      content, it is

      recommended that you specify it. The language must be specified explicitly for

      AudioAnalysisMode::Basic, since automatic language detection is not included
      in basic mode. If

      the language isn''t specified or set to null, automatic language detection will
      choose the first

      language detected and process with the selected language for the duration of
      the file. It does

      not currently support dynamically switching between languages after the first
      language is

      detected. The automatic detection works best with audio recordings with clearly
      discernable

      speech. If automatic detection fails to find the language, transcription would
      fallback to

      ''en-US''." The list of supported languages is available here:

    description: 'Defines the type of insights that you want the service to generate.

      The default

      is AllInsights. If you set this to AllInsights and the input is audio only,
      then only audio

      insights are generated. Similarly if the input is video only, then only video
      insights are

      generated. It is recommended that you not use AudioInsightsOnly if you expect
      some of your

      inputs to be video only; or use VideoInsightsOnly if you expect some of your
      inputs to be audio

      only. Your Jobs in such conditions would error out. Possible values include:
