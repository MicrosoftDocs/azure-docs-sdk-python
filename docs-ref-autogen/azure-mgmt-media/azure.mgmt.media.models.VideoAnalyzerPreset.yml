- description: 'The language for the audio payload in the input using the BCP-47 format

    of ''language tag-region'' (e.g: ''en-US'').  If you know the language of your
    content, it is

    recommended that you specify it. The language must be specified explicitly for

    AudioAnalysisMode::Basic, since automatic language detection is not included in
    basic mode. If

    the language isn''t specified or set to null, automatic language detection will
    choose the first

    language detected and process with the selected language for the duration of the
    file. It does

    not currently support dynamically switching between languages after the first
    language is

    detected. The automatic detection works best with audio recordings with clearly
    discernable

    speech. If automatic detection fails to find the language, transcription would
    fallback to

    ''en-US''." The list of supported languages is available here:

    insights are

    generated. It is recommended that you not use AudioInsightsOnly if you expect
    some of your

    inputs to be video only; or use VideoInsightsOnly if you expect some of your inputs
    to be audio

    only. Your Jobs in such conditions would error out. Known values are: "AudioInsightsOnly",
