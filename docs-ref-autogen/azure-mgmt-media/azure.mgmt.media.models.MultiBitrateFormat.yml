summary: 'Describes the properties for producing a collection of GOP aligned multi-bitrate
  files. The default behavior is to produce one output file for each video layer which
  is muxed together with all the audios. The exact output files produced can be controlled
  by specifying the outputFiles collection.


  You probably want to use the sub-classes and not this class directly. Known

  sub-classes are: Mp4Format, TransportStreamFormat.


  All required parameters must be populated in order to send to Azure.'

    The following macros are supported in the file name: {Basename} - An expansion

    use the name of the input video file. If the base name(the file suffix is not
    included) of the

    input video file is less than 32 characters long, the base name of input video
    files will be

    used. If the length of base name of the input video file exceeds 32 characters,
    the base name

    is truncated to the first 32 characters in total length. {Extension} - The appropriate

    extension for this format. {Label} - The label assigned to the codec/layer. {Index}
    - A unique

    index for thumbnails. Only applicable to thumbnails. {Bitrate} - The audio/video
    bitrate. Not

    applicable to thumbnails. {Codec} - The type of the audio/video codec. {Resolution}
    - The video

    resolution. Any unsubstituted macros will be collapsed and removed from the filename.'
