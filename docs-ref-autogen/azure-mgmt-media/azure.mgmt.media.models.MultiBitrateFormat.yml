summary: 'Describes the properties for producing a collection of GOP aligned multi-bitrate
  files. The default behavior is to produce one output file for each video layer which
  is muxed together with all the audios. The exact output files produced can be controlled
  by specifying the outputFiles collection.


  You probably want to use the sub-classes and not this class directly. Known

  sub-classes are: Mp4Format, TransportStreamFormat.


  All required parameters must be populated in order to send to Azure.'

      is not

      included) of the input video file is less than 32 characters long, the base
      name of input video

      files will be used. If the length of base name of the input video file exceeds
      32 characters,

      the base name is truncated to the first 32 characters in total length. {Extension}
      - The

      appropriate extension for this format. {Label} - The label assigned to the codec/layer.
      {Index}

      - A unique index for thumbnails. Only applicable to thumbnails. {Bitrate} -
      The audio/video

      bitrate. Not applicable to thumbnails. {Codec} - The type of the audio/video
      codec.

      {Resolution} - The video resolution. Any unsubstituted macros will be collapsed

      from the filename.'
