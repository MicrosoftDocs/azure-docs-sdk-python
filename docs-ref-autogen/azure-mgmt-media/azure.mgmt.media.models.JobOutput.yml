    identify it.

    This is useful when your Transform has more than one TransformOutput, whereby
    your Job has more

    than one JobOutput. In such cases, when you submit the Job, you will add two or
    more

    JobOutputs, in the same order as TransformOutputs in the Transform. Subsequently,
    when you

    retrieve the Job, either through events or on a GET request, you can use the label
    to easily

    identify the JobOutput. If a label is not provided, a default value of

    ''{presetName}_{outputIndex}'' will be used, where the preset name is the name
    of the preset in

    the corresponding TransformOutput and the output index is the relative index of
    the this

    JobOutput within the Job. Note that this index is the same as the relative index
    of the

    corresponding TransformOutput within its Transform.'
