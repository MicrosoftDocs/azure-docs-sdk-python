summary: 'The encoder can be configured to produce video and/or images (thumbnails)
  at different resolutions, by specifying a layer for each desired resolution. A layer
  represents the properties for the video or image at a resolution.

  You probably want to use the sub-classes and not this class directly. Known

  sub-classes are: H265VideoLayer, JpgLayer, PngLayer, VideoLayer.

  All required parameters must be populated in order to send to Azure.'
