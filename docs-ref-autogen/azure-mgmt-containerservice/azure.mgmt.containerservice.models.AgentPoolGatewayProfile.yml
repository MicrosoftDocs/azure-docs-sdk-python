    description: 'The Gateway agent pool associates one public IPPrefix for each

      static egress gateway to provide public egress. The size of Public IPPrefix
      should be selected

      by the user. Each node in the agent pool is assigned with one IP from the IPPrefix.
      The

      IPPrefix size thus serves as a cap on the size of the Gateway agent pool. Due
      to Azure public

      IPPrefix size limitation, the valid value range is [28, 31] (/31 = 2 nodes/IPs,
