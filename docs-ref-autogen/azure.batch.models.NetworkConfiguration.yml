  summary: 'The network configuration for a pool.

    - description: 'The ARM resource identifier of the virtual network

        subnet which the compute nodes of the pool will join. This is of the form

        /subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{group}/providers/{provider}/virtualNetworks/{network}/subnets/{subnet}.

        The virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the

        Azure Batch account. The specified subnet should have enough free IP

        addresses to accommodate the number of nodes in the pool. If the subnet

        doesn''t have enough free IP addresses, the pool will partially allocate

        compute nodes, and a resize error will occur. The ''MicrosoftAzureBatch''

        service principal must have the ''Classic Virtual Machine Contributor''

        Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) role for the specified VNet. The

        specified subnet must allow communication from the Azure Batch service to

        be able to schedule tasks on the compute nodes. This can be verified by

        checking if the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups

        (NSG). If communication to the compute nodes in the specified subnet is

        denied by an NSG, then the Batch service will set the state of the compute

        nodes to unusable. For pools created via virtualMachineConfiguration the

        Batch account must have poolAllocationMode userSubscription in order to

        use a VNet.
