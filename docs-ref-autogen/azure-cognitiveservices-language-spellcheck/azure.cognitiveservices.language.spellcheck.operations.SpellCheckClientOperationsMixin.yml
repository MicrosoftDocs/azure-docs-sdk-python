  summary: 'The Bing Spell Check API lets you perform contextual grammar and spell

    checking. Bing has developed a web-based spell-checker that leverages

    machine learning and statistical machine translation to dynamically

    train a constantly evolving and highly contextual algorithm. The

    spell-checker is based on a massive corpus of web searches and

    documents.'

        This header and the setLang query parameter are mutually exclusive; do

        \ For\nexample, if the second request has a different flight assignment than\n\

        \ ID to tailor web results to that client ID\u2019s search history,\nproviding\
        \ a richer experience for the user. Bing also uses this header\nto help improve\

        \ relevance improvements help with better quality of\nresults delivered by\
        \ Bing APIs and in turn enables higher\nclick-through rates for the API consumer.\
        \ IMPORTANT: Although\noptional, you should consider this header required.\
        \ Persisting the\nclient ID across multiple requests for the same end user\
        \ and device\ncombination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a consistent\

        latitude must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal

        to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern latitudes and positive

        values indicate northern latitudes. long (required): The longitude of

        the client''s location, in degrees. The longitude must be greater than

        or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to +180.0. Negative values

        indicate western longitudes and positive values indicate eastern

        longitudes. re (required): The radius, in meters, which specifies the

        horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the value returned by the

        device''s location service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi,

        380m for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup.

        ts (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the

        location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January

        1, 1970.) head (optional): The client''s relative heading or direction

        of travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through

        360, counting clockwise relative to true north. Specify this key only

        if the sp key is nonzero. sp (optional): The horizontal velocity

        (speed), in meters per second, that the client device is traveling.

        alt (optional): The altitude of the client device, in meters. are

        (optional): The radius, in meters, that specifies the vertical

        accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key only if you specify the

        alt key. Although many of the keys are optional, the more information

        that you provide, the more accurate the location results are. Although

        optional, you are encouraged to always specify the user''s geographical

        location. Providing the location is especially important if the

        client''s IP address does not accurately reflect the user''s physical

        location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For optimal results,

        you should include this header and the  X-Search-ClientIP header, but

        at a minimum, you should include this header.'
