    You cannot delete a certificate if a resource (pool or compute node) is

    using it. Before you can delete a certificate, you must therefore make

    sure that the certificate is not associated with any existing pools,

    the certificate is not installed on any compute nodes (even if you

    remove a certificate from a pool, it is not removed from existing

    compute nodes in that pool until they restart), and no running tasks

    depend on the certificate. If you try to delete a certificate that is

    in use, the deletion fails. The certificate status changes to

    deleteFailed. You can use Cancel Delete Certificate to set the status

    back to active if you decide that you want to continue using the

    certificate.
