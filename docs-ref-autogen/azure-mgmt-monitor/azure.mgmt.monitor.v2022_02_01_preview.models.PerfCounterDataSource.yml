summary: "Definition of which performance counters will be collected and how they\
  \ will be collected by this data collection rule.\nCollected from both Windows and\
  \ Linux machines where the counter is present.\n\n   ivar streams:\n      List of\
  \ streams that this data source will be sent to.\n      A stream indicates what\
  \ schema will be used for this data and usually what table in Log\n      Analytics\
  \ the data will be sent to.\n\n   vartype streams:\n      list[str or\n      ~$(python-base-namespace).v2022_02_01_preview.models.KnownPerfCounterDataSourceStreams]\n\
  \n   ivar sampling_frequency_in_seconds:\n      The number of seconds between consecutive\
  \ counter\n      measurements (samples).\n\n   vartype sampling_frequency_in_seconds:\n\
  \      int\n\n   ivar counter_specifiers:\n      A list of specifier names of the\
  \ performance counters you want to\n      collect.\n      Use a wildcard (*) to\
  \ collect a counter for all instances.\n      To get a list of performance counters\
  \ on Windows, run the command 'typeperf'.\n\n   vartype counter_specifiers:\n  \
  \    list[str]\n\n   ivar name:\n      A friendly name for the data source.\n  \
  \    This name should be unique across all data sources (regardless of type) within\
