module: azure.cognitiveservices.speech.dialog
inheritances:
- builtins.object
summary: 'An object that encapsulates turn status information as received from the
  dialog implementation that a DialogServiceConnector

  communicates with. A turn is a single execution session within the dialog implementation
  that may generate any number of

  activities over its course. The information in this payload represents success or
  failure conditions encountered by the

  dialog implementation over the course of this execution. This data facilitates the
  indication of completion or error conditions

  within the dialog implementation even when no explicit activity data is produced
  as part of a turn.'

  - name: handle
attributes:
- uid: azure.cognitiveservices.speech.dialog.TurnStatusReceivedEventArgs.conversation_id

  summary: 'The conversation identifier associated with this turn status event. Conversations

- uid: azure.cognitiveservices.speech.dialog.TurnStatusReceivedEventArgs.interaction_id
  name: interaction_id
