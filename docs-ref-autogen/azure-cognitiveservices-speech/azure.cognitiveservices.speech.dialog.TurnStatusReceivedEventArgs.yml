summary: 'An object that encapsulates turn status information as received from the

  that may generate any number of

  activities over its course. The information in this payload represents success or
  failure conditions encountered by the

  dialog implementation over the course of this execution. This data facilitates the
  indication of completion or error conditions

  within the dialog implementation even when no explicit activity data is produced
  as part of a turn.
