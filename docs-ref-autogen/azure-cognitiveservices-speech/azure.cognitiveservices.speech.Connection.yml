summary: 'Proxy class for managing the connection to the speech service of the specified

  <xref:azure.cognitiveservices.speech.Recognizer>.


  By default, a <xref:azure.cognitiveservices.speech.Recognizer> autonomously manages
  connection to service when needed. The

  <xref:azure.cognitiveservices.speech.Connection> class provides additional methods
  for users to explicitly open or close a

  connection and to subscribe to connection status changes. The use of <xref:azure.cognitiveservices.speech.Connection>
  is

  optional. It is intended for scenarios where fine tuning of application behavior
  based on connection

  status is needed. Users can optionally call <xref:azure.cognitiveservices.speech.Connection.open>
  to manually initiate a service connection

  before starting recognition on the <xref:azure.cognitiveservices.speech.Recognizer>
  associated with this <xref:azure.cognitiveservices.speech.Connection>.

  After starting a recognition, calling <xref:azure.cognitiveservices.speech.Connection.open>
  or <xref:azure.cognitiveservices.speech.Connection.close> might fail. This will
  not impact

  the Recognizer or the ongoing recognition. Connection might drop for various reasons,
  the Recognizer will

  always try to reinstitute the connection as required to guarantee ongoing operations.
  In all these cases

  <xref:azure.cognitiveservices.speech.Connection.connected>/<xref:azure.cognitiveservices.speech.Connection.disconnected>
  events will indicate the change of the connection status.
