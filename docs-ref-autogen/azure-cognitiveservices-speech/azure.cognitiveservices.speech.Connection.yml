  summary: 'Proxy class for managing the connection to the speech service of the specified

    <xref:azure.cognitiveservices.speech.Recognizer>.


    By default, a <xref:azure.cognitiveservices.speech.Recognizer> autonomously manages
    connection to service when needed. The

    <xref:azure.cognitiveservices.speech.Connection> class provides additional methods
    for users to explicitly open or close a

    connection and to subscribe to connection status changes. The use of <xref:azure.cognitiveservices.speech.Connection>
    is

    optional, and mainly for scenarios where fine tuning of application behavior based
    on

    connection status is needed. Users can optionally call <xref:azure.cognitiveservices.speech.Connection.open>
    to manually set up a

    connection in advance before starting recognition on the <xref:azure.cognitiveservices.speech.Recognizer>
    associated with

    this <xref:azure.cognitiveservices.speech.Connection>. After starting recognition,
    calling <xref:azure.cognitiveservices.speech.Connection.open> or

    <xref:azure.cognitiveservices.speech.Connection.close> might fail, depending on
    the process state of the <xref:azure.cognitiveservices.speech.Recognizer>. But

    this does not affect the state of the associated <xref:azure.cognitiveservices.speech.Recognizer>.
    And if the

    <xref:azure.cognitiveservices.speech.Recognizer> needs to connect or disconnect
    to service, it will setup or shutdown the

    connection independently. In this case the <xref:azure.cognitiveservices.speech.Connection>
    will be notified by change of

    connection status via the <xref:azure.cognitiveservices.speech.Connection.connected>/<xref:azure.cognitiveservices.speech.Connection.disconnected>
    events.
