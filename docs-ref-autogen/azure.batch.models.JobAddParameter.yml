        is created, and will try to schedule the Job Manager task before

        scheduling other tasks in the job. The Job Manager task''s typical purpose

        is to control and/or monitor job execution, for example by deciding what

        additional tasks to run, determining when the work is complete, etc.

        (However, a Job Manager task is not restricted to these activities - it is

        a fully-fledged task in the system and perform whatever actions are

        required for the job.) For example, a Job Manager task might download a

        file specified as a parameter, analyze the contents of that file and

        submit additional tasks based on those contents.

        is to undo changes to compute nodes made by the Job Preparation task.

        Example activities include deleting local files, or shutting down services

        that were started as part of job preparation.
