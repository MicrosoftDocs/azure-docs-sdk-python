  - name: timestamp_type
    description: 'Denotes the type of timestamp the message will hold.Two types of

      timestamp types - "AppendTime" and "CreateTime". AppendTime refers the time
      in which message

      got appended inside broker log. CreateTime refers to the time in which the message
      was

      generated on source side and producers can set this timestamp while sending
      the message.

      Default value is AppendTime. If you are using AMQP protocol, CreateTime equals
      AppendTime and

      its behavior remains the same. Known values are: "LogAppend" and "Create".'
