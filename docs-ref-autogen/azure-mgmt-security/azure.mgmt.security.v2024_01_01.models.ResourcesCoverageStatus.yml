summary: 'This field is available for subscription-level only, and reflects the coverage
  status of the

  resources under the subscription. Please note: The "pricingTier" field reflects
  the plan status

  of the subscription. However, since the plan status can also be defined at the resource
  level,

  there might be misalignment between the subscription''s plan status and the resource
  status.

  This field helps indicate the coverage status of the resources.'
