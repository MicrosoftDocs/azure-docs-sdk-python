    description: 'Id of a stateful service replica. ReplicaId is used by

      Service Fabric to uniquely identify a replica of a partition. It is unique

      within a partition and does not change for the lifetime of the replica. If

      a replica gets dropped and another replica gets created on the same node

      for the same partition, it will get a different value for the id.

      Sometimes the id of a stateless service instance is also referred as a

      replica id.'
