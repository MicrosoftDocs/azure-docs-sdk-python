    description: "Required. Pipeline topology describes the processing steps to be\n\
      applied when processing media for a particular outcome. The topology should\
      \ be defined\naccording to the scenario to be achieved and can be reused across\
      \ many pipeline instances which\nshare the same processing characteristics.\
      \ For instance, a pipeline topology which acquires\ndata from a RTSP camera,\
      \ process it with an specific AI model and stored the data on the cloud\ncan\
      \ be reused across many different cameras, as long as the same processing should\
      \ be applied\nacross all the cameras. Individual instance properties can be\
      \ defined through the use of\nuser-defined parameters, which allow for a topology\
      \ to be parameterized, thus allowing\nindividual pipelines to refer to different\
      \ values, such as individual cameras RTSP endpoints\nand credentials. Overall\
      \ a topology is composed of the following:\n\n* Parameters: list of user defined\
      \ parameters that can be references across the topology \n\nnodes.\n* Sources:\
      \ list of one or more data sources nodes such as an RTSP source which allows\
      \ for\nmedia to be ingested from cameras.\n* Processors: list of nodes which\
      \ perform data analysis or transformations.\n\n   -Sinks: list of one or more\
      \ data sinks which allow for data to be stored or exported to\n\nother destinations."
