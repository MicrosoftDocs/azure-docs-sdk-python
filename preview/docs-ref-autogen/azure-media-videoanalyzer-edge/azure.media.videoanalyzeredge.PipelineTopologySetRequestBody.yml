summary: "Pipeline topology describes the processing steps to be applied when processing\
  \ media for a particular outcome. The topology should be defined according to the\
  \ scenario to be achieved and can be reused across many pipeline instances which\
  \ share the same processing characteristics. For instance, a pipeline topology which\
  \ acquires data from a RTSP camera, process it with an specific AI model and stored\
  \ the data on the cloud can be reused across many different cameras, as long as\
  \ the same processing should be applied across all the cameras. Individual instance\
  \ properties can be defined through the use of user-defined parameters, which allow\
  \ for a topology to be parameterized, thus allowing individual pipelines to refer\
  \ to different values, such as individual cameras RTSP endpoints and credentials.\
  \ Overall a topology is composed of the following:\n\n* Parameters: list of user\
  \ defined parameters that can be references across the topology nodes. \n\n* Sources:\
  \ list of one or more data sources nodes such as an RTSP source which allows for\
  \ media to be ingested from cameras. \n\n* Processors: list of nodes which perform\
  \ data analysis or transformations. -Sinks: list of one or more data sinks which\
  \ allow for data to be stored or exported to other destinations. \n\n     Variables\
  \ are only populated by the server, and will be ignored when sending a request.\n\
  \n     All required parameters must be populated in order to send to Azure.\n\n\
