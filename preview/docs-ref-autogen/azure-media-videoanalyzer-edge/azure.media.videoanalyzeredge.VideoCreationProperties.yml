      playback

      latency but generate larger volume of storage transactions. Larger segments
      reduce the amount

      of storage transactions while increasing the archive playback latency. Value
      must be specified

      in ISO8601 duration format (i.e. "PT30S" equals 30 seconds) and can vary between
      30 seconds to

      5 minutes, in 30 seconds increments. Changing this value after the video is
      initially created

      can lead to errors when uploading media to the archive. Default value is 30
      seconds.'
