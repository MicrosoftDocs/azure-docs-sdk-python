      of storage transactions while increasing the archive playback latency. Value
      must be specified

      in ISO8601 duration format (i.e. "PT30S" equals 30 seconds) and can vary between
      30 seconds to

      5 minutes, in 30 seconds increments. Changing this value after the video is
      initially created
