summary: Optional video properties to be used in case a new video resource needs to
  be created on the service. These will not take effect if the video already exists.
constructor:
  syntax: 'VideoCreationProperties(*, title: str | None = None, description: str |
    None = None, segment_length: str | None = None, retention_period: str | None =
    None, **kwargs)'
variables:
- description: Optional video title provided by the user. Value can be up to 256 characters
    long.
  name: title

- description: 'Video segment length indicates the length of individual video files

    (segments) which are persisted to storage. Smaller segments provide lower archive
    playback

    latency but generate larger volume of storage transactions. Larger segments reduce
    the amount

    of storage transactions while increasing the archive playback latency. Value must
    be specified

    in ISO8601 duration format (i.e. "PT30S" equals 30 seconds) and can vary between
    30 seconds to

    5 minutes, in 30 seconds increments. Changing this value after the video is initially
    created

    can lead to errors when uploading media to the archive. Default value is 30 seconds.'

- description: 'Video retention period indicates how long the video is kept in storage,

    and must be a multiple of 1 day. For example, if this is set to 30 days, then
    content older

    than 30 days will be deleted.'
