summary: Optional video properties to be used in case a new video resource needs to
  be created on the service. These will not take effect if the video already exists.
constructor:
  syntax: 'VideoCreationProperties(*, title: Optional[str] = None, description: Optional[str]
    = None, segment_length: Optional[str] = None, **kwargs)'
  parameters:
  - name: title
    description: 'Optional video title provided by the user. Value can be up to 256
      characters

      long.'
    isRequired: true
    types:

  - name: segment_length
    description: 'Video segment length indicates the length of individual video files

      (segments) which are persisted to storage. Smaller segments provide lower archive
      playback

      latency but generate larger volume of storage transactions. Larger segments
      reduce the amount

      of storage transactions while increasing the archive playback latency. Value
      must be specified

      in ISO8601 duration format (i.e. "PT30S" equals 30 seconds) and can vary between
      30 seconds to

      5 minutes, in 30 seconds increments. Changing this value after the video is
      initially created

      can lead to errors when uploading media to the archive. Default value is 30
      seconds.'
