summary: 'Object tracker processor allows for continuous tracking of one of more objects
  over a finite sequence of video frames. It must be used downstream of an object
  detector extension node, thus allowing for the extension to be configured to to
  perform inferences on sparse frames through the use of the ''maximumSamplesPerSecond''
  sampling property. The object tracker node will then track the detected objects
  over the frames in which the detector is not invoked resulting on a smother tracking
  of detected objects across the continuum of video frames. The tracker will stop
  tracking objects which are not subsequently detected by the upstream detector on
  the subsequent detections.

  All required parameters must be populated in order to send to Azure.'
