summary: 'A signal gate determines when to block (gate) incoming media, and when to
  allow it through. It gathers input events over the activationEvaluationWindow, and
  determines whether to open or close the gate. See [https://aka.ms/ava-signalgate](https://aka.ms/ava-signalgate)
  for more information.
