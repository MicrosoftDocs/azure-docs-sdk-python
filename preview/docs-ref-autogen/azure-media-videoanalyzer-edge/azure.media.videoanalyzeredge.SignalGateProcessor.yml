summary: 'A signal gate determines when to block (gate) incoming media, and when to
  allow it through. It gathers input events over the activationEvaluationWindow, and
  determines whether to open or close the gate. See [https://aka.ms/ava-signalgate](https://aka.ms/ava-signalgate)
  for more information.

    description: 'Signal offset once the gate is activated (can be negative). It

      activation time. A negative offset indicates that data prior the activation
      time must be

      included on the signal that is let through, once the gate is activated. When
      used upstream of a

      file or video sink, this allows for scenarios such as recording buffered media
      prior an event,

      such as: record video 5 seconds prior motions is detected.'
