summary: 'A signal gate determines when to block (gate) incoming media, and when to
  allow it through. It gathers input events over the activationEvaluationWindow, and
  determines whether to open or close the gate. See [https://aka.ms/ava-signalgate](https://aka.ms/ava-signalgate)
  for more information.


  All required parameters must be populated in order to send to Azure.'

- description: 'Signal offset once the gate is activated (can be negative). It

    determines the how much farther behind of after the signal will be let through
    based on the

    activation time. A negative offset indicates that data prior the activation time
    must be

    included on the signal that is let through, once the gate is activated. When used
    upstream of a

    file or video sink, this allows for scenarios such as recording buffered media
    prior an event,

    such as: record video 5 seconds prior motions is detected.'
