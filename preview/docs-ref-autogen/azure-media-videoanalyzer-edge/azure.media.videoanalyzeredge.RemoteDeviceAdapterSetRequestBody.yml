summary: 'The Video Analyzer edge module can act as a transparent gateway for video,
  enabling IoT devices to send video to the cloud from behind a firewall. A remote
  device adapter should be created for each such IoT device. Communication between
  the cloud and IoT device would then flow via the Video Analyzer edge module.
