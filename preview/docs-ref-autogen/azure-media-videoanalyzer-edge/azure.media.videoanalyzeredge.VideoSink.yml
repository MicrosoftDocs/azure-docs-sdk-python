summary: 'Video sink allows for video and audio to be recorded to the Video Analyzer
  service. The recorded video can be played from anywhere and further managed from
  the cloud. Due to security reasons, a given Video Analyzer edge module instance
  can only record content to new video entries, or existing video entries previously
  recorded by the same module. Any attempt to record content to an existing video
  which has not been created by the same module instance will result in failure to
  record.
