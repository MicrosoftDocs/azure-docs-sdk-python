summary: 'Represents the outcome of an Image Analysis operation.


  Always start by checking the value of reason property to determine if the analysis

  operation was successful or not.


  When an analysis operation is successful, applicable properties in this object

  will be populated based on the selected features (ImageAnalysisOptions.features)

  or custom-trained model (ImageAnalysisOptions.model_name).

  These results are parsed from the service JSON response.

  Other properties will be None.


  Call ImageAnalysisResultDetails.from_result to get access to additional

  information about the result, such as the raw JSON response.


  When analysis operation failed, call ImageAnalysisErrorDetails.from_result

  to get access to additional information about the error.'
