summary: 'The Audio Analyzer preset applies a pre-defined set of AI-based analysis
  operations, including speech transcription. Currently, the preset supports processing
  of content with a single audio track.


  You probably want to use the sub-classes and not this class directly. Known

  sub-classes are: VideoAnalyzerPreset.

    description: 'The language for the audio payload in the input using the BCP-47
      format

      of ''language tag-region'' (e.g: ''en-US'').  If you know the language of your
      content, it is

      recommended that you specify it. The language must be specified explicitly for

      AudioAnalysisMode::Basic, since automatic language detection is not included
      in basic mode. If

      the language isn''t specified or set to null, automatic language detection will
      choose the first

      language detected and process with the selected language for the duration of
      the file. It does

      not currently support dynamically switching between languages after the first
      language is

      detected. The automatic detection works best with audio recordings with clearly
      discernable

      speech. If automatic detection fails to find the language, transcription would
      fallback to ''en-

      US''." The list of supported languages is available here:
