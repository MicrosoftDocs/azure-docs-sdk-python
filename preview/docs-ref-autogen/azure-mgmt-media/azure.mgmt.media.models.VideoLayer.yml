summary: 'Describes the settings to be used when encoding the input video into a desired
  output bitrate layer.


  You probably want to use the sub-classes and not this class directly. Known

  sub-classes are: H264Layer.


  All required parameters must be populated in order to send to Azure.'

  - name: width
    description: 'The width of the output video for this layer. The value can be absolute
      (in

      pixels) or relative (in percentage). For example 50% means the output video
      has half as many

      pixels in width as the input.'

    description: 'The height of the output video for this layer. The value can be

      has half as many

      pixels in height as the input.'

  - name: label
    description: 'The alphanumeric label for this layer, which can be used in multiplexing

      different video and audio layers, or in naming the output file.'

    - <xref:str>
  - name: bitrate
    description: 'Required. The average bitrate in bits per second at which to encode
      the input

      video when generating this layer. This is a required field.'

    - <xref:int>
  - name: max_bitrate
    description: 'The maximum bitrate (in bits per second), at which the VBV buffer
      should be

      assumed to refill. If not specified, defaults to the same value as bitrate.'

  - name: frame_rate
    description: 'The frame rate (in frames per second) at which to encode this layer.
      The

      value can be in the form of M/N where M and N are integers (For example, 30000/1001),
      or in the

      form of a number (For example, 30, or 29.97). The encoder enforces constraints
      on allowed frame

      rates based on the profile and level. If it is not specified, the encoder will
      use the same

      frame rate as the input video.'

  - name: slices
    description: 'The number of slices to be used when encoding this layer. If not
      specified,

      default is zero, which means that encoder will use a single slice for each frame.'

    - <xref:int>
  - name: adaptive_b_frame
    description: 'Whether or not adaptive B-frames are to be used when encoding this

      layer. If not specified, the encoder will turn it on whenever the video profile

      use.'
