      This functionality is intended for use in scenarios where the metadata endpoint
      cannot be reached, such as in

      private clouds or Azure Stack. The process of instance discovery entails retrieving
      authority metadata from

      [https://login.microsoft.com/](https://login.microsoft.com/) to validate the
      authority. By setting this to **True**, the validation of the

      authority is disabled. As a result, it is crucial to ensure that the configured
      authority host is valid and

      trustworthy.'
