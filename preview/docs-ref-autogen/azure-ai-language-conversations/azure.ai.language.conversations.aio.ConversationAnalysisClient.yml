summary: 'The language service conversations API is a suite of natural language processing
  (NLP) skills

  that can be used to analyze structured conversations (textual or spoken). The synchronous
  API

  in this suite accepts a request and mediates among multiple language projects, such
  as LUIS

  Generally Available, Question Answering, Conversational Language Understanding,
  and then calls

  the best candidate service to handle the request. At last, it returns a response
  with the

  candidate service''s response as a payload.
