summary: "The language service conversations API is a suite of natural language processing\
  \ (NLP) skills\nthat can be used to analyze structured conversations (textual or\
  \ spoken). The synchronous API\nin this suite accepts a request and mediates among\
  \ multiple language projects, such as LUIS\nGenerally Available, Question Answering,\
  \ Conversational Language Understanding, and then calls\nthe best candidate service\
  \ to handle the request. At last, it returns a response with the\ncandidate service's\
  \ response as a payload.\n\n   In some cases, this API needs to forward requests\
  \ and responses between the caller and an\n\nupstream service. The asynchronous\
  \ APIs in this suite enable tasks like Conversation\nSummarization and Conversational\
  \ PII detection."
