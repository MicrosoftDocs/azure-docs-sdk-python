summary: 'The Message header.

  The Message header. This is only used on received message, and not

  set on messages being sent. The properties set on any given message

  will depend on the Service and not all messages will have all properties.


  Please refer to the AMQP spec:

  [http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0-os.html#type-header](http://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0-os.html#type-header)

  for more information on the message header.'
