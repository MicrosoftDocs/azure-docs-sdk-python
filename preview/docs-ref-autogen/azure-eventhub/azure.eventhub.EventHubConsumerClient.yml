  summary: 'The EventHubConsumerClient class defines a high level interface for

    receiving events from the Azure Event Hubs service.


    The main goal of *EventHubConsumerClient* is to receive events from all partitions
    of an EventHub with

    load-balancing and checkpointing.


    When multiple *EventHubConsumerClient* instances are running against the same
    event hub, consumer group and

    checkpointing location, the partitions will be evenly distributed among them.


    To enable load-balancing and persisted checkpoints, checkpoint_store must be set
    when creating the

    *EventHubConsumerClient*.

    If a checkpoint store is not provided, the checkpoint will be maintained internally
    in memory.


    An *EventHubConsumerClient* can also receive from a specific partition when you
    call its method *receive()* or

    *receive_batch()* and specify the partition_id.

    Load-balancing won''t work in single-partition mode. But users can still save
    checkpoints if the checkpoint_store

    is set.'
