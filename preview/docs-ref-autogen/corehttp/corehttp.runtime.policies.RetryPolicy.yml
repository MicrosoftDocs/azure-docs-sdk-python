  - name: retry_connect
    description: 'How many connection-related errors to retry on.

      These are errors raised before the request is sent to the remote server,

      which we assume has not triggered the server to process the request. Default
      value is 3.'

    description: 'How many times to retry on read errors.

      These errors are raised after the request was sent to the server, so the

      request may have side-effects. Default value is 3.'

    description: 'A backoff factor to apply between attempts after the second try

      (most errors are resolved immediately by a second try without a delay).

      In fixed mode, retry policy will always sleep for {backoff factor}.

      In ''exponential'' mode, retry policy will sleep for: *{backoff factor} * (2
      ** ({number of total retries} - 1))*
