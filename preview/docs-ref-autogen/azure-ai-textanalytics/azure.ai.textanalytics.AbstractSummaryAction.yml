summary: 'AbstractSummaryAction encapsulates the parameters for starting a long-running

  abstractive summarization operation. For a conceptual discussion of extractive summarization,

  see the service documentation:

  [https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/language-service/summarization/overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/language-service/summarization/overview)


  Abstractive summarization generates a summary for the input documents. Abstractive
  summarization

  is different from extractive summarization in that extractive summarization is the
  strategy of

  concatenating extracted sentences from the input document into a summary, while
  abstractive

  summarization involves paraphrasing the document using novel sentences.
