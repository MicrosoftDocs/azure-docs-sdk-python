      service checks the hash of the content that has arrived with the hash

      that was sent. This is primarily valuable for detecting bitflips on

      the wire if using http instead of https as https (the default) will

      already validate. Note that this MD5 hash is not stored with the

      blob. Also note that if enabled, the memory-efficient upload algorithm

      will not be used, because computing the MD5 hash requires buffering

      entire blocks, and doing so defeats the purpose of the memory-efficient algorithm.'
