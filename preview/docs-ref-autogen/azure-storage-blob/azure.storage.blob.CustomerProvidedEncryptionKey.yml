summary: 'All data in Azure Storage is encrypted at-rest using an account-level encryption
  key.

  In versions 2018-06-17 and newer, you can manage the key used to encrypt blob contents

  and application metadata per-blob by providing an AES-256 encryption key in requests
  to the storage service.


  When you use a customer-provided key, Azure Storage does not manage or persist your
  key.

  When writing data to a blob, the provided key is used to encrypt your data before
  writing it to disk.

  A SHA-256 hash of the encryption key is written alongside the blob contents,

  and is used to verify that all subsequent operations against the blob use the same
  encryption key.

  This hash cannot be used to retrieve the encryption key or decrypt the contents
  of the blob.

  When reading a blob, the provided key is used to decrypt your data after reading
  it from disk.

  In both cases, the provided encryption key is securely discarded

  as soon as the encryption or decryption process completes.'
