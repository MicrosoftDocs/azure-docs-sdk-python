    We have helper methods to create requests specific to this service in *azure.messaging.webpubsub.rest*.

    Use these helper methods to create the request you pass to this method. See our
    example below:



    ```


    >>> from azure.messaging.webpubsub.rest import build_healthapi_get_health_status_request

    >>> request = build_healthapi_get_health_status_request(api_version)

    <HttpRequest [HEAD], url: ''/api/health''>

    >>> response = client.send_request(request)

    <HttpResponse: 200 OK>

    ```
