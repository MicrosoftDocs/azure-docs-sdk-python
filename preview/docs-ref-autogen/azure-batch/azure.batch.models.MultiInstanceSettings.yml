summary: 'Multi-instance Tasks are commonly used to support MPI Tasks. In the MPI
  case,

  if any of the subtasks fail (for example due to exiting with a non-zero exit

  code) the entire multi-instance Task fails. The multi-instance Task is then

  terminated and retried, up to its retry limit.


  All required parameters must be populated in order to send to server.'
