  summary: 'Creates a Job to the specified Account.


    The Batch service supports two ways to control the work done as part of a Job.

    In the first approach, the user specifies a Job Manager Task. The Batch service

    launches this Task when it is ready to start the Job. The Job Manager Task

    controls all other Tasks that run under this Job, by using the Task APIs. In

    the second approach, the user directly controls the execution of Tasks under an

    active Job, by using the Task APIs. Also note: when naming Jobs, avoid

    including sensitive information such as user names or secret project names.

    This information may appear in telemetry logs accessible to Microsoft Support

    engineers.'

    \ Jobs, you should normally\n             specify a jobManagerTask in the jobSpecification.\
    \ If you do not use\n             jobManagerTask, you will need an external process\

    \ recurring, and the startWindow is longer than the recurrence interval, then\n\

    \ is 'due'\n             in one recurrenceInterval is not carried forward into\
    \ the next recurrence\n             interval. The default is infinite. The minimum\

    \ the Task. This will only work with a\n             VirtualMachineConfiguration\
    \ Pool. The virtual network must be in the same\n             region and subscription\
    \ as the Azure Batch Account. The specified subnet\n             should have enough\
    \ free IP addresses to accommodate the number of Compute\n             Nodes which\
    \ will run Tasks from the Job. This can be up to the number of\n             Compute\
    \ Nodes in the Pool. The 'MicrosoftAzureBatch' service principal must\n      \
    \       have the 'Classic Virtual Machine Contributor' Role-Based Access Control\n\
    \             (RBAC) role for the specified VNet so that Azure Batch service can\
    \ schedule\n             Tasks on the Nodes. This can be verified by checking\
    \ if the specified VNet\n             has any associated Network Security Groups\
    \ (NSG). If communication to the\n             Nodes in the specified subnet is\
    \ denied by an NSG, then the Batch service\n             will set the state of\
    \ the Compute Nodes to unusable. This is of the form\n             /subscriptions/{subscription}/resourceGroups/{group}/providers/{provider}/virtualNetworks/{network}/subnets/{subnet}.\n\
    \             If the specified VNet has any associated Network Security Groups\
    \ (NSG), then\n             a few reserved system ports must be enabled for inbound\
    \ communication from\n             the Azure Batch service. For Pools created\
    \ with a Virtual Machine\n             configuration, enable ports 29876 and 29877,\
    \ as well as port 22 for Linux and\n             port 3389 for Windows. Port 443\
    \ is also required to be open for outbound\n             connections for communications\
    \ to Azure Storage. For more details see:\n             https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/batch/batch-api-basics#virtual-network-vnet-and-firewall-configuration.\n\

    \ Schedule can have at most one active Job under it at any\n             given\
    \ time. Because a Job Schedule can have at most one active Job under it\n    \
    \         at any given time, if it is time to create a new Job under a Job Schedule,\n\
    \             but the previous Job is still running, the Batch service will not\
    \ create the\n             new Job until the previous Job finishes. If the previous\

    \ then no new Job\n             will be scheduled for that interval. For recurring\
    \ Jobs, you should normally\n             specify a jobManagerTask in the jobSpecification.\
    \ If you do not use\n             jobManagerTask, you will need an external process\
    \ to monitor when Jobs are\n             created, add Tasks to the Jobs and terminate\
    \ the Jobs ready for the next\n             recurrence. The default is that the\
    \ schedule does not recur: one Job is\n             created, within the startWindow\
    \ after the doNotRunUntil time, and the\n             schedule is complete as\
    \ soon as that Job finishes. The minimum value is 1\n             minute. If you\
    \ specify a lower value, the Batch service rejects the schedule\n            \
    \ with an error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code\n\
    \             is 400 (Bad Request).\n           \"startWindow\": \"1 day, 0:00:00\"\

    \ the schedule indicates a Job should be\n             created, within which a\
    \ Job must be created. If a Job is not created within\n             the startWindow\
    \ interval, then the 'opportunity' is lost; no Job will be\n             created\
    \ until the next recurrence of the schedule. If the schedule is\n            \
    \ recurring, and the startWindow is longer than the recurrence interval, then\n\
    \             this is equivalent to an infinite startWindow, because the Job that\
    \ is 'due'\n             in one recurrenceInterval is not carried forward into\
    \ the next recurrence\n             interval. The default is infinite. The minimum\
