  summary: 'Creates a Job to the specified Account.


    The Batch service supports two ways to control the work done as part of a Job.

    In the first approach, the user specifies a Job Manager Task. The Batch service

    launches this Task when it is ready to start the Job. The Job Manager Task

    controls all other Tasks that run under this Job, by using the Task APIs. In

    the second approach, the user directly controls the execution of Tasks under an

    active Job, by using the Task APIs. Also note: when naming Jobs, avoid

    including sensitive information such as user names or secret project names.

    This information may appear in telemetry logs accessible to Microsoft Support

    engineers.'

    : \"1 day, 0:00:00\",  # Optional. The time\n             interval between the\
    \ start times of two successive Jobs under the Job\n             Schedule. A Job\
    \ Schedule can have at most one active Job under it at any\n             given\
    \ time. Because a Job Schedule can have at most one active Job under it\n    \
    \         at any given time, if it is time to create a new Job under a Job Schedule,\n\
    \             but the previous Job is still running, the Batch service will not\
    \ create the\n             new Job until the previous Job finishes. If the previous\
    \ Job does not finish\n             within the startWindow period of the new recurrenceInterval,\
    \ then no new Job\n             will be scheduled for that interval. For recurring\
    \ Jobs, you should normally\n             specify a jobManagerTask in the jobSpecification.\
    \ If you do not use\n             jobManagerTask, you will need an external process\
    \ to monitor when Jobs are\n             created, add Tasks to the Jobs and terminate\
    \ the Jobs ready for the next\n             recurrence. The default is that the\
    \ schedule does not recur: one Job is\n             created, within the startWindow\
    \ after the doNotRunUntil time, and the\n             schedule is complete as\
    \ soon as that Job finishes. The minimum value is 1\n             minute. If you\
    \ specify a lower value, the Batch service rejects the schedule\n            \
    \ with an error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code\n\
    \             is 400 (Bad Request).\n           \"startWindow\": \"1 day, 0:00:00\"\

    \ the schedule indicates a Job should be\n             created, within which a\
    \ Job must be created. If a Job is not created within\n             the startWindow\
    \ interval, then the 'opportunity' is lost; no Job will be\n             created\
    \ until the next recurrence of the schedule. If the schedule is\n            \
    \ recurring, and the startWindow is longer than the recurrence interval, then\n\
    \             this is equivalent to an infinite startWindow, because the Job that\
    \ is 'due'\n             in one recurrenceInterval is not carried forward into\
    \ the next recurrence\n             interval. The default is infinite. The minimum\
    \ value is 1 minute. If you\n             specify a lower value, the Batch service\
    \ rejects the schedule with an error;\n             if you are calling the REST\

    \ soon as that Job finishes. The minimum value is 1\n             minute. If you\

    \ Job must be created. If a Job is not created within\n             the startWindow\
    \ interval, then the 'opportunity' is lost; no Job will be\n             created\
    \ until the next recurrence of the schedule. If the schedule is\n            \
    \ recurring, and the startWindow is longer than the recurrence interval, then\n\

    \             interval between the start times of two successive Jobs under the\
    \ Job\n             Schedule. A Job Schedule can have at most one active Job under\
    \ it at any\n             given time. Because a Job Schedule can have at most\
    \ one active Job under it\n             at any given time, if it is time to create\
    \ a new Job under a Job Schedule,\n             but the previous Job is still\
    \ running, the Batch service will not create the\n             new Job until the\
    \ previous Job finishes. If the previous Job does not finish\n             within\
    \ the startWindow period of the new recurrenceInterval, then no new Job\n    \
    \         will be scheduled for that interval. For recurring Jobs, you should\
    \ normally\n             specify a jobManagerTask in the jobSpecification. If\
    \ you do not use\n             jobManagerTask, you will need an external process\
    \ to monitor when Jobs are\n             created, add Tasks to the Jobs and terminate\
    \ the Jobs ready for the next\n             recurrence. The default is that the\
    \ schedule does not recur: one Job is\n             created, within the startWindow\
    \ after the doNotRunUntil time, and the\n             schedule is complete as\
    \ soon as that Job finishes. The minimum value is 1\n             minute. If you\
    \ specify a lower value, the Batch service rejects the schedule\n            \
    \ with an error; if you are calling the REST API directly, the HTTP status code\n\
    \             is 400 (Bad Request).\n           \"startWindow\": \"1 day, 0:00:00\"\
    \  # Optional. The time interval,\n             starting from the time at which\
    \ the schedule indicates a Job should be\n             created, within which a\
    \ Job must be created. If a Job is not created within\n             the startWindow\
    \ interval, then the 'opportunity' is lost; no Job will be\n             created\
    \ until the next recurrence of the schedule. If the schedule is\n            \
    \ recurring, and the startWindow is longer than the recurrence interval, then\n\
    \             this is equivalent to an infinite startWindow, because the Job that\
    \ is 'due'\n             in one recurrenceInterval is not carried forward into\
    \ the next recurrence\n             interval. The default is infinite. The minimum\
    \ value is 1 minute. If you\n             specify a lower value, the Batch service\
    \ rejects the schedule with an error;\n             if you are calling the REST\
    \ API directly, the HTTP status code is 400 (Bad\n             Request).\n   \
