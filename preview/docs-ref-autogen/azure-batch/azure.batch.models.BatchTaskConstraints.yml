- description: 'The maximum number of times the Task may be retried. The Batch

    service retries a Task if its exit code is nonzero. Note that this value specifically
    controls

    the number of retries for the Task executable due to a nonzero exit code. The
    Batch service

    will try the Task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the
    maximum retry

    count is 3, Batch tries the Task up to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries).
    If the maximum

    retry count is 0, the Batch service does not retry the Task after the first attempt.
    If the

    maximum retry count is -1, the Batch service retries the Task without limit, however
    this is

    not recommended for a start task or any task. The default value is 0 (no retries).'
