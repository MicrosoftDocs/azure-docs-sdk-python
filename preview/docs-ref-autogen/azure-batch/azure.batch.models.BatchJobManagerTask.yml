summary: 'Specifies details of a Job Manager Task.

  The Job Manager Task is automatically started when the Job is created. The

  Batch service tries to schedule the Job Manager Task before any other Tasks in

  the Job. When shrinking a Pool, the Batch service tries to preserve Nodes where

  Job Manager Tasks are running for as long as possible (that is, Compute Nodes

  running ''normal'' Tasks are removed before Compute Nodes running Job Manager

  Tasks). When a Job Manager Task fails and needs to be restarted, the system

  tries to schedule it at the highest priority. If there are no idle Compute

  Nodes available, the system may terminate one of the running Tasks in the Pool

  and return it to the queue in order to make room for the Job Manager Task to

  restart. Note that a Job Manager Task in one Job does not have priority over

  Tasks in other Jobs. Across Jobs, only Job level priorities are observed. For

  example, if a Job Manager in a priority 0 Job needs to be restarted, it will

  not displace Tasks of a priority 1 Job. Batch will retry Tasks when a recovery

  operation is triggered on a Node. Examples of recovery operations include (but

  are not limited to) when an unhealthy Node is rebooted or a Compute Node

  disappeared due to host failure. Retries due to recovery operations are

  independent of and are not counted against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the

  maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an internal retry due to a recovery operation may

  occur. Because of this, all Tasks should be idempotent. This means Tasks need

  to tolerate being interrupted and restarted without causing any corruption or

  duplicate data. The best practice for long running Tasks is to use some form of

  checkpointing.
