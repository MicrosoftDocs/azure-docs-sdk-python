    None, **kwargs)'
  parameters:
  - name: max_wall_clock_time
    description: 'If the Job does not complete within the time

      limit, the Batch service terminates it and any Tasks that are still

      running. In this case, the termination reason will be

      MaxWallClockTimeExpiry. If this property is not specified, there is no

      time limit on how long the Job may run.'

    types:

  - name: max_task_retry_count
    description: 'The maximum number of times each Task may be

      retried. The Batch service retries a Task if its exit code is nonzero.

      Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries. The

      Batch service will try each Task once, and may then retry up to this

      limit. For example, if the maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries a Task up

      to 4 times (one initial try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is

      0, the Batch service does not retry Tasks. If the maximum retry count is

      -1, the Batch service retries Tasks without limit. The default value is 0

      (no retries).'
