summary: 'Batch will retry Tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a Node.

  Examples of recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an

  unhealthy Node is rebooted or a Compute Node disappeared due to host failure.

  Retries due to recovery operations are independent of and are not counted

  against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an internal

  retry due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of this, all Tasks should

  be idempotent. This means Tasks need to tolerate being interrupted and

  restarted without causing any corruption or duplicate data. The best practice

  for long running Tasks is to use some form of checkpointing.


  Readonly variables are only populated by the server, and will be ignored when sending
