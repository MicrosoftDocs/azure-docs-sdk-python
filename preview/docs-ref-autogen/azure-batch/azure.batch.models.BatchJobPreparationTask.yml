summary: 'A Job Preparation Task to run before any Tasks of the Job on any given Compute
  Node.

  You can use Job Preparation to prepare a Node to run Tasks for the Job.

  Activities commonly performed in Job Preparation include: Downloading common

  resource files used by all the Tasks in the Job. The Job Preparation Task can

  download these common resource files to the shared location on the Node.

  (AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIRshared), or starting a local service on the Node so

  that all Tasks of that Job can communicate with it. If the Job Preparation Task

  fails (that is, exhausts its retry count before exiting with exit code 0),

  Batch will not run Tasks of this Job on the Node. The Compute Node remains

  ineligible to run Tasks of this Job until it is reimaged. The Compute Node

  remains active and can be used for other Jobs. The Job Preparation Task can run

  multiple times on the same Node. Therefore, you should write the Job

  Preparation Task to handle re-execution. If the Node is rebooted, the Job

  Preparation Task is run again on the Compute Node before scheduling any other

  Task of the Job, if rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess is true or if the Job

  Preparation Task did not previously complete. If the Node is reimaged, the Job

  Preparation Task is run again before scheduling any Task of the Job. Batch will

  retry Tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a Node. Examples of

  recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an unhealthy Node is

  rebooted or a Compute Node disappeared due to host failure. Retries due to

  recovery operations are independent of and are not counted against the

  maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an internal retry due to

  a recovery operation may occur. Because of this, all Tasks should be

  idempotent. This means Tasks need to tolerate being interrupted and restarted

  without causing any corruption or duplicate data. The best practice for long

  running Tasks is to use some form of checkpointing.
