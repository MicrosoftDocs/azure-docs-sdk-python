summary: 'A specification for uploading files from an Azure Batch Compute Node to

  another location after the Batch service has finished executing the Task

  process.


  On every file uploads, Batch service writes two log files to the compute

  node, ''fileuploadout.txt'' and ''fileuploaderr.txt''. These log files are used

  to learn more about a specific failure.


  All required parameters must be populated in order to send to Azure.'

  parameters:
  - name: file_pattern
    description: 'Required. Both relative and absolute paths are

      supported. Relative paths are relative to the Task working directory. The

      following wildcards are supported: * matches 0 or more characters (for

      example pattern abc* would match abc or abcdef), ** matches any directory,

      ? matches any single character, [abc] matches one character in the

      brackets, and [a-c] matches one character in the range. Brackets can

      include a negation to match any character not specified (for example

      [!abc] matches any character but a, b, or c). If a file name starts with

      "." it is ignored by default but may be matched by specifying it

      explicitly (for example *.gif will not match .a.gif, but .*.gif will). A

      simple example: >>**<<*.txt matches any file that does not start in ''.'' and

      ends with .txt in the Task working directory or any subdirectory. If the

      filename contains a wildcard character it can be escaped using brackets

      (for example abc[*] would match a file named abc*). Note that both and

      / are treated as directory separators on Windows, but only / is on Linux.

      Environment variables (%var% on Windows or $var on Linux) are expanded

      prior to the pattern being applied.'
