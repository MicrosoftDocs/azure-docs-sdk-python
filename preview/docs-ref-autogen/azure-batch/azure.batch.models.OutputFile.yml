    paths are supported. Relative paths are relative to the Task working directory.
    The following

    wildcards are supported: * matches 0 or more characters (for example pattern abc*
    would match

    abc or abcdef), ** matches any directory, ? matches any single character, [abc]
    matches one

    character in the brackets, and [a-c] matches one character in the range. Brackets
    can include a

    negation to match any character not specified (for example [!abc] matches any
    character but a,

    b, or c). If a file name starts with "." it is ignored by default but may be matched
    by

    specifying it explicitly (for example *.gif will not match .a.gif, but .*.gif
    will). A simple

    example: >>**<<*.txt matches any file that does not start in ''.'' and ends with
    .txt in the Task

    working directory or any subdirectory. If the filename contains a wildcard character
    it can be

    escaped using brackets (for example abc[*] would match a file named abc*). Note
    that both

    and / are treated as directory separators on Windows, but only / is on Linux.
    Environment

    variables (%var% on Windows or $var on Linux) are expanded prior to the pattern
    being applied.
