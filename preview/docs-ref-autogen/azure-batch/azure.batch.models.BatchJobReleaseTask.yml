summary: 'A Job Release Task to run on Job completion on any Compute Node where the
  Job has run.

  The Job Release Task runs when the Job ends, because of one of the following:

  The user calls the Terminate Job API, or the Delete Job API while the Job is

  still active, the Job''s maximum wall clock time constraint is reached, and the

  Job is still active, or the Job''s Job Manager Task completed, and the Job is

  configured to terminate when the Job Manager completes. The Job Release Task

  runs on each Node where Tasks of the Job have run and the Job Preparation Task

  ran and completed. If you reimage a Node after it has run the Job Preparation

  Task, and the Job ends without any further Tasks of the Job running on that

  Node (and hence the Job Preparation Task does not re-run), then the Job Release

  Task does not run on that Compute Node. If a Node reboots while the Job Release

  Task is still running, the Job Release Task runs again when the Compute Node

  starts up. The Job is not marked as complete until all Job Release Tasks have

  completed. The Job Release Task runs in the background. It does not occupy a

  scheduling slot; that is, it does not count towards the taskSlotsPerNode limit

  specified on the Pool.'
