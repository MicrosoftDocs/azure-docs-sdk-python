summary: 'A Job Preparation Task to run before any Tasks of the Job on any given

  Compute Node.


  You can use Job Preparation to prepare a Node to run Tasks for the Job.

  Activities commonly performed in Job Preparation include: Downloading

  common resource files used by all the Tasks in the Job. The Job Preparation

  Task can download these common resource files to the shared location on the

  Node. (AZ_BATCH_NODE_ROOT_DIRshared), or starting a local service on the

  Node so that all Tasks of that Job can communicate with it. If the Job

  Preparation Task fails (that is, exhausts its retry count before exiting

  with exit code 0), Batch will not run Tasks of this Job on the Node. The

  Compute Node remains ineligible to run Tasks of this Job until it is

  reimaged. The Compute Node remains active and can be used for other Jobs.

  The Job Preparation Task can run multiple times on the same Node.

  Therefore, you should write the Job Preparation Task to handle

  re-execution. If the Node is rebooted, the Job Preparation Task is run

  again on the Compute Node before scheduling any other Task of the Job, if

  rerunOnNodeRebootAfterSuccess is true or if the Job Preparation Task did

  not previously complete. If the Node is reimaged, the Job Preparation Task

  is run again before scheduling any Task of the Job. Batch will retry Tasks

  when a recovery operation is triggered on a Node. Examples of recovery

  operations include (but are not limited to) when an unhealthy Node is

  rebooted or a Compute Node disappeared due to host failure. Retries due to

  recovery operations are independent of and are not counted against the

  maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an internal retry

  due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of this, all Tasks should be

  idempotent. This means Tasks need to tolerate being interrupted and

  restarted without causing any corruption or duplicate data. The best

  practice for long running Tasks is to use some form of checkpointing.
