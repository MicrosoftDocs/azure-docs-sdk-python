    until the next

    recurrence of the schedule. If the schedule is recurring, and the startWindow
    is longer than

    the recurrence interval, then this is equivalent to an infinite startWindow, because
    the Job

    the previous Job

    does not finish within the startWindow period of the new recurrenceInterval, then
    no new Job

    will be scheduled for that interval. For recurring Jobs, you should normally specify
    a

    jobManagerTask in the jobSpecification. If you do not use jobManagerTask, you
    will need an

    external process to monitor when Jobs are created, add Tasks to the Jobs and terminate
    the Jobs

    one Job is

    created, within the startWindow after the doNotRunUntil time, and the schedule
    is complete as
