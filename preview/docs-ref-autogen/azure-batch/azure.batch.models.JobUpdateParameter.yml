      be changed from terminatejob to noaction. You may not change the value

      from terminatejob to noaction - that is, once you have engaged automatic

      Job termination, you cannot turn it off again. If you try to do this, the

      request fails and Batch returns status code 400 (Bad Request) and an

      ''invalid property value'' error response. If you do not specify this

      element in a PUT request, it is equivalent to passing noaction. This is an

      error if the current value is terminatejob. Possible values include:

      ''noAction'', ''terminateJob'''
