    The virtual network must be in the same region and subscription as the Azure Batch
    Account. The

    specified subnet should have enough free IP addresses to accommodate the number
    of Compute

    Nodes in the Pool. If the subnet doesn''t have enough free IP addresses, the Pool
    will partially

    allocate Nodes and a resize error will occur. The ''MicrosoftAzureBatch'' service
    principal must

    have the ''Classic Virtual Machine Contributor'' Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
    role for the

    specified VNet. The specified subnet must allow communication from the Azure Batch
    service to

    be able to schedule Tasks on the Nodes. This can be verified by checking if the
    specified VNet

    has any associated Network Security Groups (NSG). If communication to the Nodes
    in the

    specified subnet is denied by an NSG, then the Batch service will set the state
    of the Compute

    Nodes to unusable. For Pools created with virtualMachineConfiguration only ARM
    virtual networks

    (''Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks'') are supported. If the specified VNet has
    any associated

    Network Security Groups (NSG), then a few reserved system ports must be enabled
    for inbound

    communication. For Pools created with a virtual machine configuration, enable
    ports 29876 and

    29877, as well as port 22 for Linux and port 3389 for Windows. Also enable outbound
    connections

    to Azure Storage on port 443. For more details see:
