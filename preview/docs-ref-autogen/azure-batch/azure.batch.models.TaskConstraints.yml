  - name: max_task_retry_count
    description: 'The maximum number of times the Task may be

      retried. The Batch service retries a Task if its exit code is nonzero.

      Note that this value specifically controls the number of retries for the

      Task executable due to a nonzero exit code. The Batch service will try the

      Task once, and may then retry up to this limit. For example, if the

      maximum retry count is 3, Batch tries the Task up to 4 times (one initial

      try and 3 retries). If the maximum retry count is 0, the Batch service

      does not retry the Task after the first attempt. If the maximum retry

      count is -1, the Batch service retries the Task without limit, however

      this is not recommended for a start task or any task. The default value is

      0 (no retries).'
