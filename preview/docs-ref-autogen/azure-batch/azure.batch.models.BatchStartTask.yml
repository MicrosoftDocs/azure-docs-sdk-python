summary: 'Batch will retry Tasks when a recovery operation is triggered on a Node.

  Examples of recovery operations include (but are not limited to) when an

  unhealthy Node is rebooted or a Compute Node disappeared due to host failure.

  Retries due to recovery operations are independent of and are not counted

  against the maxTaskRetryCount. Even if the maxTaskRetryCount is 0, an internal

  retry due to a recovery operation may occur. Because of this, all Tasks should

  be idempotent. This means Tasks need to tolerate being interrupted and

  restarted without causing any corruption or duplicate data. The best practice

  for long running Tasks is to use some form of checkpointing. In some cases the

  StartTask may be re-run even though the Compute Node was not rebooted. Special

  care should be taken to avoid StartTasks which create breakaway process or

  install/launch services from the StartTask working directory, as this will

  block Batch from being able to re-run the StartTask.
