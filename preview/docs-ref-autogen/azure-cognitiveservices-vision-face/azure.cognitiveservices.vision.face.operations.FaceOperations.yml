  summary: 'Detect human faces in an image, return face rectangles, and optionally

    with faceIds, landmarks, and attributes.<br />

    * No image will be stored. Only the extracted face feature will be

    stored on server. The faceId is an identifier of the face feature and

    will be used in [Face -

    Identify](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/face/identify),

    Verify](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/face/verifyfacetoface),

    and [Face - Find

    Similar](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/faceapi/face/findsimilar).

    The stored face feature(s) will expire and be deleted at the time

    specified by faceIdTimeToLive after the original detection call.

    * Optional parameters include faceId, landmarks, and attributes.

    Attributes include age, gender, headPose, smile, facialHair, glasses,

    emotion, hair, makeup, occlusion, accessories, blur, exposure, noise,

    mask, and qualityForRecognition. Some of the results returned for

    specific attributes may not be highly accurate.

    * JPEG, PNG, GIF (the first frame), and BMP format are supported. The

    allowed image file size is from 1KB to 6MB.

    1920x1080 pixels will need a proportionally larger minimum face size.

    200x200 pixels (100 pixels between eyes) or bigger.
