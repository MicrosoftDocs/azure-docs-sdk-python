summary: 'This activity will fail within its own scope and output a custom error message
  and error code. The error message and code can provided either as a string literal
  or as an expression that can be evaluated to a string at runtime. The activity scope
  can be the whole pipeline or a control activity (e.g. foreach, switch, until), if
  the fail activity is contained in it.
