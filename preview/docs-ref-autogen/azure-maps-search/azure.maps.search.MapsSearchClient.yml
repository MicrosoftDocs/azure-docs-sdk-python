  summary: 'Use to get longitude and latitude coordinates of a street address or name
    of a place.


    The `Get Geocoding` API is an HTTP `GET` request that returns the longitude and
    latitude

    coordinates of the location being searched.


    In many cases, the complete search service might be too much, for instance if
    you are only

    interested in traditional geocoding. Search can also be accessed for address look
    up

    exclusively. The geocoding is performed by hitting the geocoding endpoint with
    just the address

    or partial address in question. The geocoding search index will be queried for
    everything above

    the street level data. No Point of Interest (POIs) will be returned. Note that
    the geocoder is

    very tolerant of typos and incomplete addresses. It will also handle everything
    from exact

    street addresses or street or intersections as well as higher level geographies
    such as city

    centers, counties and states. The response also returns detailed address properties
    such as

    street, postal code, municipality, and country/region information.'
