summary: 'Represents an identifier of an unknown type.


  It will be encountered in communications with endpoints that are not

  identifiable by this version of the SDK.


  For checking yet unknown identifiers it is better to rely on the presence of the
  *raw_id* property,

  as new or existing distinct type identifiers always contain the *raw_id* property.

  It is not advisable to rely on the *kind* property with a value *unknown*,

  as it could become a new or existing distinct type in the future.'
