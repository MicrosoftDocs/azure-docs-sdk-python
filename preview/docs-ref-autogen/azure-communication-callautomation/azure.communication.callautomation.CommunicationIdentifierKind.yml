summary: 'Communication Identifier Kind.


  For checking yet unknown identifiers it is better to rely on the presence of the
  *raw_id* property,

  as new or existing distinct type identifiers always contain the *raw_id* property.

  It is not advisable to rely on the *kind* property with a value *unknown*,

  as it could become a new or existing distinct type in the future.'
