summary: 'A label selector is composed of two parts, matchLabels and matchExpressions.
  The first part,

  matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels
  map is

  equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is ''key'', the operator
  is ''In'',

  and the values array contains only ''value''. The second part, matchExpressions
  is a list of

  resource selector requirements. Valid operators include In, NotIn, Exists, and DoesNotExist.

  The values set must be non-empty in the case of In and NotIn. The values set must
  be empty in

  the case of Exists and DoesNotExist. All of the requirements, from both matchLabels
  and

  matchExpressions must all be satisfied in order to match.'
