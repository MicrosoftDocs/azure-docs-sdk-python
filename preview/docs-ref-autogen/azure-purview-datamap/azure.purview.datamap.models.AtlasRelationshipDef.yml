summary: 'AtlasRelationshipDef is a TypeDef that defines a relationship.

  As with other typeDefs the AtlasRelationshipDef has a name. Once created the

  RelationshipDef has a guid.

  The name and the guid are the 2 ways that the

  RelationshipDef is identified.

  RelationshipDefs have 2 ends, each of which

  specify cardinality, an EntityDef type name and name and optionally

  whether the

  end is a container.

  RelationshipDefs can have AttributeDefs - though only

  primitive types are allowed.

  RelationshipDefs have a relationshipCategory

  specifying the UML type of relationship required

  The way EntityDefs and

  RelationshipDefs are intended to be used is that EntityDefs will define

  AttributeDefs these AttributeDefs

  will not specify an EntityDef type name as

  their types.

  RelationshipDefs introduce new attributes to the entity

  instances. For example

  EntityDef A might have attributes attr1,attr2,attr3


  EntityDef B might have attributes attr4,attr5,attr6

  RelationshipDef

  AtoB might define 2 ends


  end1:  type A, name attr7

  end2:  type B, name attr8


  When an instance of EntityDef A is created, it

  will have attributes attr1,attr2,attr3,attr7

  When an instance of EntityDef

  B is created, it will have attributes attr4,attr5,attr6,attr8


  In this way

  relationshipDefs can be authored separately from entityDefs and can inject

  relationship attributes into

  the entity instances.'
