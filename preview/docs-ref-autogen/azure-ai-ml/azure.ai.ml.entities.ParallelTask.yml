  - name: entry_script
    description: 'User script which will be run in parallel on multiple nodes. This
      is

      specified as a local file path.

      The entry_script should contain two functions:

      `init()`: this function should be used for any costly or common preparation
      for subsequent inferences,

      e.g., deserializing and loading the model into a global object.

      `run(mini_batch)`: The method to be parallelized. Each invocation will have
      one mini-batch.

      ''mini_batch'': Batch inference will invoke run method and pass either a list
      or a Pandas DataFrame as an

      argument to the method. Each entry in min_batch will be a filepath if input
      is a FileDataset,

      a Pandas DataFrame if input is a TabularDataset.

      run() method should return a Pandas DataFrame or an array.

      For append_row output_action, these returned elements are appended into the
      common output file.

      For summary_only, the contents of the elements are ignored. For all output actions,

      each returned output element indicates one successful inference of input element
      in the input mini-batch.

      Each parallel worker process will call *init* once and then loop over *run*
      function until all mini-batches

      are processed.'
