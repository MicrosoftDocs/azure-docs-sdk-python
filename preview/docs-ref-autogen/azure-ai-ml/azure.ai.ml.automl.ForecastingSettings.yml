    isRequired: true
    types:
    - <xref:str>
  - name: forecast_horizon
    description: The desired maximum forecast horizon in units of time-series frequency.
    isRequired: true
    types:
    - <xref:int>
  - name: target_lags
    description: The number of past periods to lag from the target column. Use 'auto'
      to use the automatic heuristic based lag.

      of the target column.
    isRequired: true
    types:
    - <xref:int>
  - name: frequency
    description: Forecast frequency. When forecasting, this parameter represents the
      period with which the forecast is desired, for example daily, weekly, yearly,
      etc.

    types:
    - <xref:str>
  - name: feature_lags

    description: 'The function to be used to aggregate the time series target column
      to conform to a user specified frequency. If the target_aggregation_function
      is set, but the freq parameter is not set, the error is raised. The possible
      target aggregation functions are: "sum", "max", "min" and "mean".'
