summary: 'Health statuses have following meanings. The ''healthy'' status shows that
  the endpoint is

  accepting messages as expected. The ''unhealthy'' status shows that the endpoint
  is not accepting

  messages as expected and IoT Hub is retrying to send data to this endpoint. The
  status of an

  unhealthy endpoint will be updated to healthy when IoT Hub has established an eventually

  consistent state of health. The ''dead'' status shows that the endpoint is not accepting

  messages, after IoT Hub retried sending messages for the retrial period. See IoT
  Hub metrics to

  identify errors and monitor issues with endpoints. The ''unknown'' status shows
  that the IoT Hub

  has not established a connection with the endpoint. No messages have been delivered
  to or

  rejected from this endpoint'
