    description: 'Whether content recording is enabled as part

      of the traces or not. Content in this context refers to chat message content

      and function call tool related function names, function parameter names and

      values. *True* will enable content recording, *False* will disable it. If no

      Please note that successive calls to instrument will always apply the content

      recording value provided with the most recent call to instrument (including

      applying the environment variable if no value is provided and defaulting to
      *False*

      if the environment variable is not found), even if instrument was already previously
