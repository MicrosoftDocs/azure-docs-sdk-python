summary: 'Constrains effort on reasoning for reasoning models.


  Currently supported values are none, minimal, low, medium, and high.


  Reducing reasoning effort can result in faster responses and fewer tokens used on
  reasoning in

  a response.


  gpt-5.1 defaults to none, which does not perform reasoning. The supported reasoning
  values for

  gpt-5.1 are none, low, medium, and high. Tool calls are supported for all reasoning
  values in

  gpt-5.1.


  All models before gpt-5.1 default to medium reasoning effort, and do not support
  none.


  The gpt-5-pro model defaults to (and only supports) high reasoning effort.'
