- description: 'The ImmutabilityPolicy state defines the mode of the policy. Disabled
    state

    disables the policy, Unlocked state allows increase and decrease of immutability
    retention time

    and also allows toggling allowProtectedAppendWrites property, Locked state only
    allows the

    increase of the immutability retention time. A policy can only be created in a
    Disabled or

    Unlocked state and can be toggled between the two states. Only a policy in an
    Unlocked state

    can transition to a Locked state which cannot be reverted. Possible values include:
    "Unlocked",

    "Locked", "Disabled".'
