summary: 'Authenticates users through the device code flow.


  When <xref:azure.identity.DeviceCodeCredential.get_token> is called, this credential
  acquires a verification URL and code from Microsoft Entra ID.

  A user must browse to the URL, enter the code, and authenticate with Microsoft Entra
  ID. If the user

  authenticates successfully, the credential receives an access token.


  This credential is primarily useful for authenticating a user in an environment
  without a web browser, such as an

  SSH session. If a web browser is available, <xref:azure.identity.InteractiveBrowserCredential>
  is more

  convenient because it automatically opens a browser to the login page.'
