summary: 'Authenticates users through the device code flow.


  When <xref:azure.identity.get_token> is called, this credential acquires a verification
  URL and code from Azure Active Directory.

  A user must browse to the URL, enter the code, and authenticate with Azure Active
  Directory. If the user

  authenticates successfully, the credential receives an access token.
