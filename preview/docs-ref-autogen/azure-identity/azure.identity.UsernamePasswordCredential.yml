summary: 'Authenticates a user with a username and password.


  In general, Microsoft doesn''t recommend this kind of authentication, because it''s
  less secure than other

  authentication flows.


  Authentication with this credential is not interactive, so it is **not compatible
  with any form of

  multi-factor authentication or consent prompting**. The application must already
  have consent from the user or

  a directory admin.


  This credential can only authenticate work and school accounts; Microsoft accounts
  are not supported.
