summary: 'Authenticates a user with a username and password.


  In general, Microsoft doesn''t recommend this kind of authentication, because it''s
  less secure than other

  authentication flows.


  Authentication with this credential is not interactive, so it is **not compatible
  with any form of

  multi-factor authentication or consent prompting**. The application must already
  have consent from the user or

  a directory admin.


  This credential can only authenticate work and school accounts; Microsoft accounts
  are not supported.

  See [Microsoft Entra ID documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/fundamentals/sign-up-organization)
  for more information about

  account types.'

      This functionality is intended for use in scenarios where the metadata endpoint
      cannot be reached, such as in

      private clouds or Azure Stack. The process of instance discovery entails retrieving
      authority metadata from

      [https://login.microsoft.com/](https://login.microsoft.com/) to validate the
      authority. By setting this to **True**, the validation of the

      authority is disabled. As a result, it is crucial to ensure that the configured
