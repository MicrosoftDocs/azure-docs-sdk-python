  summary: 'Authenticates a user with a username and password.


    In general, Microsoft doesn''t recommend this kind of authentication, because
    it''s less secure than other

    authentication flows.


    Authentication with this credential is not interactive, so it is **not compatible
    with any form of

    multi-factor authentication or consent prompting**. The application must already
    have consent from the user or

    a directory admin.


    This credential can only authenticate work and school accounts; Microsoft accounts
    are not supported.

    See this document for more information about account types:
