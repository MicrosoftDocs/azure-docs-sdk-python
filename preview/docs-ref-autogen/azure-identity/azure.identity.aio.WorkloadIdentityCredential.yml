summary: 'Authenticates using an Azure Active Directory workload identity.


  Workload identity authentication is a feature in Azure that allows applications
  running on virtual machines (VMs)

  to access other Azure resources without the need for a service principal or managed
  identity. With workload

  identity authentication, applications authenticate themselves using their own identity,
  rather than using a shared

  service principal or managed identity. Under the hood, workload identity authentication
  uses the concept of Service

  Account Credentials (SACs), which are automatically created by Azure and stored
  securely in the VM. By using

  workload identity authentication, you can avoid the need to manage and rotate service
  principals or managed

  identities for each application on each VM. Additionally, because SACs are created
  automatically and managed by

  Azure, you don''t need to worry about storing and securing sensitive credentials
  themselves.


  The WorkloadIdentityCredential supports Azure workload identity authentication on
  Azure Kubernetes and acquires

  a token using the service account credentials available in the Azure Kubernetes
  environment. Refer

  to [this workload identity overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/workload-identity-overview)

  for more information.'
