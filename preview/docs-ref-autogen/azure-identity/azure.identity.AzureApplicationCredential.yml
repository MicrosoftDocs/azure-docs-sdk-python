summary: "A credential for Azure Active Directory applications.\n\nThis credential\
  \ is designed for applications deployed to Azure (<xref:azure.identity.DefaultAzureCredential>\
  \ is\nbetter suited to local development). It authenticates service principals and\
  \ managed identities.\n\nFor service principal authentication, set these environment\
  \ variables to identify a principal:\n\n   * **AZURE_TENANT_ID**: ID of the service\
  \ principal's tenant. Also called its \"directory\" ID. \n\n   * **AZURE_CLIENT_ID**:\
  \ the service principal's client ID \n\nAnd one of these to authenticate that principal:\n\
  \n   * **AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET**: one of the service principal's client secrets \n\
  \n   **or**\n\n   * **AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH**: path to a PEM-encoded certificate\
  \ file including the private key. The certificate must not be password-protected.\

  \ a managed identity.\nSee [Azure Active Directory documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview)\
