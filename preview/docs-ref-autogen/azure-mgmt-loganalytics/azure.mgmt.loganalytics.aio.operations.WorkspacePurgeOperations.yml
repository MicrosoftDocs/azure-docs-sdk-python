    In order to manage system resources, purge requests are throttled at 50 requests
    per hour. You

    should batch the execution of purge requests by sending a single command whose
    predicate

    includes all user identities that require purging. Use the in operator to specify
    multiple

    identities. You should run the query prior to using for a purge request to verify
    that the

    results are expected.

    Log Analytics only supports purge operations required for compliance with GDPR.
    The Log

    Analytics product team reserves the right to reject requests for purge operations
