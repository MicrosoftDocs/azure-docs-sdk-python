  summary: 'CORS is an HTTP feature that enables a web application running under one

    domain to access resources in another domain. Web browsers implement a

    security restriction known as same-origin policy that prevents a web page

    from calling APIs in a different domain; CORS provides a secure way to

    allow one domain (the origin domain) to call APIs in another domain.


    All required parameters must be populated in order to send to Azure.'
