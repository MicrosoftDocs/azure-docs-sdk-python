    Default: regular database creation.


    Copy: creates a database as a copy of an existing database. sourceDatabaseId must
    be specified

    as the resource ID of the source database.


    Secondary: creates a database as a secondary replica of an existing database.
    sourceDatabaseId

    must be specified as the resource ID of the existing primary database.


    PointInTimeRestore: Creates a database by restoring a point in time backup of
    an existing

    database. sourceDatabaseId must be specified as the resource ID of the existing
    database, and

    restorePointInTime must be specified.


    Recovery: Creates a database by restoring a geo-replicated backup. sourceDatabaseId
    must be

    specified as the recoverable database resource ID to restore.


    Restore: Creates a database by restoring a backup of a deleted database. sourceDatabaseId
    must

    be specified. If sourceDatabaseId is the database''s original resource ID, then

    sourceDatabaseDeletionDate must be specified. Otherwise sourceDatabaseId must
    be the restorable

    dropped database resource ID and sourceDatabaseDeletionDate is ignored. restorePointInTime
    may

    also be specified to restore from an earlier point in time.


    RestoreLongTermRetentionBackup: Creates a database by restoring from a long term
    retention

    vault. recoveryServicesRecoveryPointResourceId must be specified as the recovery
    point resource

    ID.
