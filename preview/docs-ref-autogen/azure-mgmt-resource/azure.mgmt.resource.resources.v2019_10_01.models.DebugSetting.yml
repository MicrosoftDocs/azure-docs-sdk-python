        values are none, requestContent, responseContent, or both requestContent and
        responseContent

        separated by a comma. The default is none. When setting this value, carefully
        consider the type

        of information you are passing in during deployment. By logging information
        about the request

        or response, you could potentially expose sensitive data that is retrieved
        through the

        deployment operations.'
