  summary: 'Allows you to take control over the process of converting text into indexable/searchable
    tokens. It''s a user-defined configuration consisting of a single predefined tokenizer
    and one or more filters. The tokenizer is responsible for breaking text into tokens,
    and the filters for modifying tokens emitted by the tokenizer.
