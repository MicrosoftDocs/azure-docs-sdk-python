    that no one, not

    even Microsoft, can decrypt them in Azure Cognitive Search. Once you have encrypted
    your

    indexer definition, it will always remain encrypted. Azure Cognitive Search will
    ignore

    attempts to set this property to null. You can change this property as needed
    if you want to

    rotate your encryption key; Your indexer definition (and indexer execution status)
    will be

    unaffected. Encryption with customer-managed keys is not available for free search
    services,

    and is only available for paid services created on or after January 1, 2019.'
