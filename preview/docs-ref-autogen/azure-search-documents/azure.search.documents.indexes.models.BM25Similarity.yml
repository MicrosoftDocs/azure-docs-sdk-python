summary: 'Ranking function based on the Okapi BM25 similarity algorithm. BM25 is a
  TF-IDF-like algorithm

  that includes length normalization (controlled by the ''b'' parameter) as well as
  term frequency

  saturation (controlled by the ''k1'' parameter).


  All required parameters must be populated in order to send to Azure.'

      a value of

      1.2 is used. A value of 0.0 means the score does not scale with an increase
