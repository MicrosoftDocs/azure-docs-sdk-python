  summary: 'A character filter that replaces characters in the input string. It uses
    a regular expression to identify character sequences to preserve and a replacement
    pattern to identify characters to replace. For example, given the input text "aa
    bb aa bb", pattern "(aa)s+(bb)", and replacement "$1#$2", the result would be
    "aa#bb aa#bb". This character filter is implemented using Apache Lucene.
