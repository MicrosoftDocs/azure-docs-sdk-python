      This key is used to provide an additional level of encryption-at-rest for your
      datasource

      definition when you want full assurance that no one, not even Microsoft, can
      decrypt your data

      source definition in Azure Cognitive Search. Once you have encrypted your data
      source

      definition, it will always remain encrypted. Azure Cognitive Search will ignore
      attempts to set

      this property to null. You can change this property as needed if you want to
      rotate your

      encryption key; Your datasource definition will be unaffected. Encryption with
      customer-managed

      keys is not available for free search services, and is only available for paid
      services created

      on or after January 1, 2019.'
