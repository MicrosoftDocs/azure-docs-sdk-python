summary: 'A character filter that replaces characters in the input string. It uses
  a regular expression

  to identify character sequences to preserve and a replacement pattern to identify
  characters to

  replace. For example, given the input text "aa bb aa bb", pattern "(aa)s+(bb)",
  and

  replacement "$1#$2", the result would be "aa#bb aa#bb". This token filter is implemented
  using

  Apache Lucene.


  All required parameters must be populated in order to send to Azure.'
