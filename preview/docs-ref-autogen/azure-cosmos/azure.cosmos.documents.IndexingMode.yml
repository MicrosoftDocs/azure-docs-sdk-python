inheritances:

summary: Specifies the supported indexing modes.
constructor:
  syntax: IndexingMode()
attributes:
- uid: azure.cosmos.documents.IndexingMode.Consistent
  name: Consistent
  summary: 'Index is updated synchronously with a create or update operation. With

    consistent indexing, query behavior is the same as the default

    consistency level for the collection.

    The index is always kept up to date with the data.'
  signature: 'Consistent: Literal[''consistent''] = ''consistent'''
- uid: azure.cosmos.documents.IndexingMode.Lazy
  name: Lazy
  summary: 'Index is updated asynchronously with respect to a create or update

    operation. Not supported for new containers since June/2020.

    With lazy indexing, queries are eventually consistent. The index is

    updated when the collection is idle.'
  signature: 'Lazy: Literal[''lazy''] = ''lazy'''
- uid: azure.cosmos.documents.IndexingMode.NoIndex
  name: NoIndex
  summary: 'No index is provided.

    Setting IndexingMode to "None" drops the index. Use this if you don''t

    want to maintain the index for a document collection, to save the

    storage cost or improve the write throughput. Your queries will

    degenerate to scans of the entire collection.'
