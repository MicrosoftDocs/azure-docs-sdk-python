      Supported options:

      If False, only scores and indices are returned. Default is True.

      * **top_k** (int): Maximum number of documents to return in the reranked results.
      If not specified, all documents are returned.

      * **batch_size** (int): Number of documents to process in each batch. Used for
      optimizing performance with large document sets.

      * **sort** (bool): Whether to sort the results by relevance score in descending
      order. Default is True.

      * **document_type** (str): Type of documents being reranked. Supported values
      are "string" and "json".

      * **target_paths** (str): If document_type is "json", the list of JSON paths
      to extract text from for reranking. Comma-separated string.'
