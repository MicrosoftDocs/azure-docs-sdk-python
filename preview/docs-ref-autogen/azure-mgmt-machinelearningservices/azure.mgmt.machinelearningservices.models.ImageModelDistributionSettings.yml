summary: 'Distribution expressions to sweep over values of model settings.


  `<example>

  Some examples are:

  ```

  ModelName = "choice(''seresnext'', ''resnest50'')";

  LearningRate = "uniform(0.001, 0.01)";

  LayersToFreeze = "choice(0, 2)";

  >>``<<*</example>*

  All distributions can be specified as distribution_name(min, max) or choice(val1,
  val2, ...,

  valn)

  where distribution name can be: uniform, quniform, loguniform, etc

  For more details on how to compose distribution expressions please check the documentation:
