  - name: max_percent_unhealthy_deployed_applications
    description: 'The maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy

      deployed applications. Allowed values are Byte values from zero to 100.

      The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of deployed applications
      that can

      be unhealthy before the application is considered in error.

      This is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy deployed applications
      over the number

      of nodes where the application is currently deployed on in the cluster.

      The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of nodes.
      Default

      percentage is zero.'
