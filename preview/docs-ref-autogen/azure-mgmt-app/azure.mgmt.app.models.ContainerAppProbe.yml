- description: 'Optional duration in seconds the pod needs to terminate

    gracefully upon probe failure. The grace period is the duration in seconds after
    the processes

    running in the pod are sent a termination signal and the time when the processes
    are forcibly

    halted with a kill signal. Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time
    for your

    process. If this value is nil, the pod''s terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be
    used. Otherwise,

    this value overrides the value provided by the pod spec. Value must be non-negative
    integer.

    The value zero indicates stop immediately via the kill signal (no opportunity
    to shut down).

    This is an alpha field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature
    gate. Maximum

    value is 3600 seconds (1 hour).'
