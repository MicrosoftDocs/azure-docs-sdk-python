    might be

    is in an error

    state. If your service is in the degraded, disabled, or error states, it means
    the Azure

    Cognitive Search team is actively investigating the underlying issue. Dedicated
    services in

    these states are still chargeable based on the number of search units provisioned.

    ''failed''. Client applications can poll provisioning status (the recommended
    polling interval is

    from 30 seconds to one minute) by using the Get Search Service operation to see
    when an

    operation is completed. If you are using the free service, this value tends to
    come back as

    ''succeeded'' directly in the call to Create Search service. This is because the
    free service

    uses capacity that is already set up. Known values are: "succeeded", "provisioning",
