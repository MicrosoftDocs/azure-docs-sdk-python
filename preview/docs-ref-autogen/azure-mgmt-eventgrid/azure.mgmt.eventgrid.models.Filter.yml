summary: 'This is the base type that represents a filter. To configure a filter, do
  not directly

  instantiate an object of this class. Instead, instantiate

  an object of a derived class such as BoolEqualsFilter, NumberInFilter, StringEqualsFilter
  etc

  depending on the type of the key based on

  which you want to filter.


  You probably want to use the sub-classes and not this class directly. Known sub-classes
  are:

  BoolEqualsFilter, IsNotNullFilter, IsNullOrUndefinedFilter, NumberGreaterThanFilter,

  NumberGreaterThanOrEqualsFilter, NumberInFilter, NumberInRangeFilter, NumberLessThanFilter,

  NumberLessThanOrEqualsFilter, NumberNotInFilter, NumberNotInRangeFilter,

  StringBeginsWithFilter, StringContainsFilter, StringEndsWithFilter, StringInFilter,

  StringNotBeginsWithFilter, StringNotContainsFilter, StringNotEndsWithFilter, StringNotInFilter


  All required parameters must be populated in order to send to server.'
