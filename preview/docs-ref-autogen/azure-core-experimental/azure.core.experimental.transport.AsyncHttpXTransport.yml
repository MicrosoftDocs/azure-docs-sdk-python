  name: sleep
  summary: 'Sleep for the specified duration.


    You should always ask the transport to sleep, and not call directly

    the stdlib. This is mostly important in async, as the transport

    may not use asyncio but other implementation like trio and they their own

    way to sleep, but to keep design

    consistent, it''s cleaner to always ask the transport to sleep and let the transport

    implementor decide how to do it.

    By default, this method will use "asyncio", and don''t need to be overridden

    if your transport does too.'
  signature: 'async sleep(duration: float) -> None'
  parameters:
  - name: duration
    description: The number of seconds to sleep.
    isRequired: true
