  configured with

  Windows nodes (that is, created with cloudServiceConfiguration, or with

  virtualMachineConfiguration using a Windows image reference). For Linux compute
  nodes, the

  certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory and an
  environment

  variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to query for this location.
  For

  certificates with visibility of ''remoteUser'', a ''certs'' directory is created
  in the user''s home

  directory (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that directory.'
