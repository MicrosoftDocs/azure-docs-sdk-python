  summary: "**Route Directions Batch API**\n\n**Applies to**: see pricing [tiers](https://aka.ms/AzureMapsPricingTier).\n\
    \nThe Route Directions Batch API sends batches of queries to [Route Directions\
    \ API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections) using\
    \ just a single API\ncall. You can call Route Directions Batch API to run either\
    \ asynchronously (async) or\nsynchronously (sync). The async API allows caller\
    \ to batch up to **700** queries and sync API\nup to **100** queries.\n\n# Submit\
    \ Asynchronous Batch Request\n\nThe Asynchronous API is appropriate for processing\
    \ big volumes of relatively complex route\nrequests\n\n* It allows the retrieval\
    \ of results in a separate call (multiple downloads are possible). \n\n* The asynchronous\
    \ API is optimized for reliability and is not expected to run into a timeout.\
    \ \n\n* The number of batch items is limited to **700** for this API. \n\nWhen\
    \ you make a request by using async request, by default the service returns a\
    \ 202 response\ncode along a redirect URL in the Location field of the response\
    \ header. This URL should be\nchecked periodically until the response data or\
    \ error information is available.\nThe asynchronous responses are stored for **14**\
    \ days. The redirect URL returns a 404 response\nif used after the expiration\
    \ period.\n\nPlease note that asynchronous batch request is a long-running request.\
    \ Here's a typical\nsequence of operations:\n\n1. Client sends a Route Directions\
    \ Batch `POST` request to Azure Maps \n\n2. The server will respond with one of\
    \ the following: \n\n      HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch request has been accepted.\n\
    \n      HTTP `Error` - There was an error processing your Batch request. This\
    \ could either be a\n      `400 Bad Request` or any other `Error` status code.\n\
    \n3. If the batch request was accepted successfully, the `Location` header in\
    \ the response contains the URL to download the results of the batch request.\
    \ This status URI looks like following: \n\n   `GET https://atlas.microsoft.com/route/directions/batch/{batch-id}?api-version=1.0`\n\
    \   Note:- Please remember to add AUTH information (subscription-key/azure_auth\
    \ - See <xref:security>) to the *status URI* before running it.\n\n4. Client issues\
    \ a `GET` request on the *download URL* obtained in Step 3 to download the batch\
    \ results. \n\n# POST Body for Batch Request\n\nTo send the *route directions*\
    \ queries you will use a `POST` request where the request body\nwill contain the\
    \ `batchItems` array in `json` format and the `Content-Type` header will\nbe set\
    \ to `application/json`. Here's a sample request body containing 3 *route directions*\n\
    queries:\n\n<!-- literal_block {\"ids\": [], \"classes\": [], \"names\": [], \"\
    dupnames\": [], \"backrefs\": [], \"xml:space\": \"preserve\", \"force\": false,\
    \ \"language\": \"json\", \"highlight_args\": {}, \"linenos\": false} -->\n\n\

    \ a partial URL *without* the protocol, base URL,\npath, api-version and subscription-key.\
    \ It can accept any of the supported *route directions*\n[URI parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#uri-parameters).\
    \ The\nstring values in the *route directions* query must be properly escaped\
    \ (e.g. \" character should\nbe escaped with ) and it should also be properly\
    \ URL-encoded.\n\nThe async API allows caller to batch up to **700** queries and\
    \ sync API up to **100** queries,\nand the batch should contain at least **1**\
    \ query.\n\n# Download Asynchronous Batch Results\n\nTo download the async batch\
    \ results you will issue a `GET` request to the batch download\nendpoint. This\
    \ *download URL* can be obtained from the `Location` header of a successful\n\
    `POST` batch request and looks like the following:\n\n<!-- literal_block {\"ids\"\
    : [], \"classes\": [], \"names\": [], \"dupnames\": [], \"backrefs\": [], \"xml:space\"\

    \nHere's the typical sequence of operations for downloading the batch results:\n\
    \n1. Client sends a `GET` request using the *download URL*. \n\n2. The server\
    \ will respond with one of the following: \n\n      HTTP `202 Accepted` - Batch\
    \ request was accepted but is still being processed. Please\n      try again in\
    \ some time.\n\n      HTTP `200 OK` - Batch request successfully processed. The\
    \ response body contains all\n      the batch results.\n\n# Batch Response Model\n\
    \nThe returned data content is similar for async and sync requests. When downloading\
    \ the results\nof an async batch request, if the batch has finished processing,\
    \ the response body contains the\nbatch response. This batch response contains\
    \ a `summary` component that indicates the\n`totalRequests` that were part of\
    \ the original batch request and `successfulRequests`i.e. queries which were executed\
    \ successfully. The batch response also includes a\n`batchItems` array which contains\
    \ a response for each and every query in the batch request.\nThe `batchItems`\
    \ will contain the results in the exact same order the original queries were\n\
    sent in the batch request. Each item in `batchItems` contains `statusCode` and\
    \ `response`\nfields. Each `response` in `batchItems` is of one of the following\
    \ types:\n\n* *``RouteDirections`* <[https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#routedirections](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/maps/route/getroutedirections#routedirections)>`_\
    \ - If the query completed successfully. \n\n* `Error` - If the query failed.\
    \ The response will contain a `code` and a `message` in this case. \n\nHere's\
    \ a sample Batch Response with 1 *successful* and 1 *failed* result:\n\n<!-- literal_block\

    \nThe Matrix Routing service allows calculation of a matrix of route summaries\
    \ for a set of\nroutes defined by origin and destination locations by using an\
    \ asynchronous (async) or\nsynchronous (sync) POST request. For every given origin,\
    \ the service calculates the cost of\nrouting from that origin to every given\
    \ destination. The set of origins and the set of\ndestinations can be thought\
    \ of as the column and row headers of a table and each cell in the\ntable contains\
    \ the costs of routing from the origin to the destination for that cell. As an\n\
    example, let's say a food delivery company has 20 drivers and they need to find\
    \ the closest\ndriver to pick up the delivery from the restaurant. To solve this\
    \ use case, they can call\nMatrix Route API.\n\nFor each route, the travel times\
    \ and distances are returned. You can use the computed costs to\ndetermine which\
    \ detailed routes to calculate using the Route Directions API.\n\nThe maximum\
    \ size of a matrix for async request is **700** and for sync request it's **100**\n\

    \ Synchronous Route Matrix Request\n\nIf your scenario requires synchronous requests\
    \ and the maximum size of the matrix is less than\nor equal to 100, you might\
    \ want to make synchronous request. The maximum size of a matrix for\nthis API\
    \ is **100** (the number of origins multiplied by the number of destinations).\
    \ With that\nconstraint in mind, examples of possible matrix dimensions are: 10x10,\

    \ to batch up to **700** queries and sync API\nup to **100** queries.\n\n# Submit\
    \ Synchronous Batch Request\n\nThe Synchronous API is recommended for lightweight\
    \ batch requests. When the service receives a\nrequest, it will respond as soon\
    \ as the batch items are calculated and there will be no\npossibility to retrieve\
    \ the results later. The Synchronous API will return a timeout error (a\n408 response)\

    \nThe Matrix Routing service allows calculation of a matrix of route summaries\
    \ for a set of\nroutes defined by origin and destination locations by using an\
    \ asynchronous (async) or\nsynchronous (sync) POST request. For every given origin,\
    \ the service calculates the cost of\nrouting from that origin to every given\
    \ destination. The set of origins and the set of\ndestinations can be thought\
    \ of as the column and row headers of a table and each cell in the\ntable contains\
    \ the costs of routing from the origin to the destination for that cell. As an\n\
    example, let's say a food delivery company has 20 drivers and they need to find\
    \ the closest\ndriver to pick up the delivery from the restaurant. To solve this\
    \ use case, they can call\nMatrix Route API.\n\nFor each route, the travel times\
    \ and distances are returned. You can use the computed costs to\ndetermine which\
    \ detailed routes to calculate using the Route Directions API.\n\nThe maximum\
    \ size of a matrix for async request is **700** and for sync request it's **100**\n\
    (the number of origins multiplied by the number of destinations).\n\n# Submit\
    \ Synchronous Route Matrix Request\n\nIf your scenario requires synchronous requests\
    \ and the maximum size of the matrix is less than\nor equal to 100, you might\
    \ want to make synchronous request. The maximum size of a matrix for\nthis API\
    \ is **100** (the number of origins multiplied by the number of destinations).\
    \ With that\nconstraint in mind, examples of possible matrix dimensions are: 10x10,\
    \ 6x8, 9x8 (it does not\nneed to be square).\n\n<!-- literal_block {\"ids\": [],\
