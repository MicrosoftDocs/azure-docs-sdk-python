      services.


      The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of services that
      can be unhealthy

      before the application is considered in error.

      If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy service,
      the health is

      evaluated as Warning.

      This is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy services of the specific
      service type

      over the total number of services of the specific service type.

      The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of services.'
