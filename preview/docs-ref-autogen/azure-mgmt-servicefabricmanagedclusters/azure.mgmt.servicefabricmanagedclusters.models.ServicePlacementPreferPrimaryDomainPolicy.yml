summary: 'Describes the policy to be used for placement of a Service Fabric service
  where the service''s

  Primary replicas should optimally be placed in a particular domain.


  This placement policy is usually used with fault domains in scenarios where the
  Service Fabric

  cluster is geographically distributed in order to indicate that a service''s primary
  replica

  should

  be located in a particular fault domain, which in geo-distributed scenarios usually
  aligns with

  regional

  or datacenter boundaries. Note that since this is an optimization it is possible
  that the

  Primary replica

  may not end up located in this domain due to failures, capacity limits, or other
  constraints.


  All required parameters must be populated in order to send to server.'
