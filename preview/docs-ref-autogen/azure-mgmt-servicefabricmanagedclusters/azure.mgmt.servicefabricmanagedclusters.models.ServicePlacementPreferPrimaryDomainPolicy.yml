summary: "Describes the policy to be used for placement of a Service Fabric service\
  \ where the service's\nPrimary replicas should optimally be placed in a particular\
  \ domain.\n\nThis placement policy is usually used with fault domains in scenarios\
  \ where the Service Fabric\ncluster is geographically distributed in order to indicate\
  \ that a service's primary replica should\nbe located in a particular fault domain,\
  \ which in geo-distributed scenarios usually aligns with regional\nor datacenter\
  \ boundaries. Note that since this is an optimization it is possible that the Primary\
  \ replica\nmay not end up located in this domain due to failures, capacity limits,\
  \ or other constraints.\n\n   All required parameters must be populated in order\
  \ to send to Azure.\n\n   ivar type:\n      The type of placement policy for a service\
  \ fabric service. Following are the\n      possible values. Required. Known values\
  \ are: \"InvalidDomain\", \"RequiredDomain\",\n      \"PreferredPrimaryDomain\"\
  , \"RequiredDomainDistribution\", and \"NonPartiallyPlaceService\".\n\n   vartype\
  \ type:\n      str or\n      ~azure.mgmt.servicefabricmanagedclusters.models.ServicePlacementPolicyType\n\
