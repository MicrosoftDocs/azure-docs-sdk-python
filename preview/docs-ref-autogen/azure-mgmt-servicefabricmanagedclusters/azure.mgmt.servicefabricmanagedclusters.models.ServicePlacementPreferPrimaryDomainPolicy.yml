summary: "Describes the policy to be used for placement of a Service Fabric service\
  \ where the service's\nPrimary replicas should optimally be placed in a particular\
  \ domain.\n\nThis placement policy is usually used with fault domains in scenarios\
  \ where the Service Fabric\ncluster is geographically distributed in order to indicate\
  \ that a service's primary replica should\nbe located in a particular fault domain,\
  \ which in geo-distributed scenarios usually aligns with regional\nor datacenter\
  \ boundaries. Note that since this is an optimization it is possible that the Primary\
  \ replica\nmay not end up located in this domain due to failures, capacity limits,\
  \ or other constraints.\n\n   All required parameters must be populated in order\
  \ to send to Azure.\n\n   ivar type:\n      Required. The type of placement policy\
  \ for a service fabric service. Following are\n      the possible values.Constant\
  \ filled by server. Possible values include: \"InvalidDomain\",\n      \"RequiredDomain\"\
  , \"PreferredPrimaryDomain\", \"RequiredDomainDistribution\",\n      \"NonPartiallyPlaceService\"\
