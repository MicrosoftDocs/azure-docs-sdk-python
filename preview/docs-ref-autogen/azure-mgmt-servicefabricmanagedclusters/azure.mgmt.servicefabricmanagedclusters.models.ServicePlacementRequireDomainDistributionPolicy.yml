summary: "Describes the policy to be used for placement of a Service Fabric service\
  \ where two replicas\nfrom the same partition should never be placed in the same\
  \ fault or upgrade domain.\n\nWhile this is not common it can expose the service\
  \ to an increased risk of concurrent failures\ndue to unplanned outages or other\
  \ cases of subsequent/concurrent failures. As an example, consider\na case where\
  \ replicas are deployed across different data center, with one replica per location.\n\
  In the event that one of the datacenters goes offline, normally the replica that\
  \ was placed in that\ndatacenter will be packed into one of the remaining datacenters.\
  \ If this is not desirable then this\npolicy should be set.\n\n   All required parameters\
  \ must be populated in order to send to Azure.\n\n   ivar type:\n      The type\
  \ of placement policy for a service fabric service. Following are the\n      possible\
  \ values. Required. Known values are: \"InvalidDomain\", \"RequiredDomain\",\n \
  \     \"PreferredPrimaryDomain\", \"RequiredDomainDistribution\", and \"NonPartiallyPlaceService\"\
