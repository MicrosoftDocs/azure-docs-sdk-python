summary: 'Describes the policy to be used for placement of a Service Fabric service
  where two replicas

  from the same partition should never be placed in the same fault or upgrade domain.


  While this is not common it can expose the service to an increased risk of concurrent
  failures

  due to unplanned outages or other cases of subsequent/concurrent failures. As an
  example,

  consider

  a case where replicas are deployed across different data center, with one replica
  per location.

  In the event that one of the datacenters goes offline, normally the replica that
  was placed in

  that

  datacenter will be packed into one of the remaining datacenters. If this is not
  desirable then

  this

  policy should be set.


  All required parameters must be populated in order to send to Azure.'
