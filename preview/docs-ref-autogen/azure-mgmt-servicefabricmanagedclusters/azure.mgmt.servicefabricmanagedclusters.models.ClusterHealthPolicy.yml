    description: 'The maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy nodes before

      reporting an error. For example, to allow 10% of nodes to be unhealthy, this
      value would be 10.


      The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of nodes that can
      be unhealthy

      before the cluster is considered in error.

      If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy node, the
      health is

      evaluated as Warning.

      The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy nodes over
      the total number

      of nodes in the cluster.

      The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of nodes.
      Default

      percentage is zero.


      In large clusters, some nodes will always be down or out for repairs, so this
      percentage

      should be configured to tolerate that. Required.'
