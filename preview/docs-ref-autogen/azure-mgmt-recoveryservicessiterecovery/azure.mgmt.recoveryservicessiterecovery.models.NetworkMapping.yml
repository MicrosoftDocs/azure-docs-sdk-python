summary: 'Network Mapping model. Ideally it should have been possible to inherit this
  class from prev version in InheritedModels as long as there is no difference in
  structure or method signature. Since there were no base Models for certain fields
  and methods viz NetworkMappingProperties and Load with required return type, the
  class has been introduced in its entirety with references to base models to facilitate
  extensions in subsequent versions.
