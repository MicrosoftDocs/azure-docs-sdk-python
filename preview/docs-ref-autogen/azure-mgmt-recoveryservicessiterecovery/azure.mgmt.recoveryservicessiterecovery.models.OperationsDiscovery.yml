summary: Operations discovery class.

  syntax: 'OperationsDiscovery(*, name: Optional[str] = None, display: Optional[azure.mgmt.recoveryservicessiterecovery.models._models_py3.Display]
    = None, origin: Optional[str] = None, properties: Optional[Any] = None, **kwargs)'
  parameters:
  - name: name
    description: 'Name of the API. The name of the operation being performed on this
      particular

      object. It should match the action name that appears in RBAC / the event service.
      Examples of

      operations include: * Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/capture/action *

      Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/restart/action * Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/write
      *

      Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/read * Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachine/delete
      Each action

      should include, in order: (1) Resource Provider Namespace (2) Type hierarchy
      for which the

      action applies (e.g. server/databases for a SQL Azure database) (3) Read, Write,
      Action or

      Delete indicating which type applies. If it is a PUT/PATCH on a collection or
      named value,

      Write should be used. If it is a GET, Read should be used. If it is a DELETE,
      Delete should be

      used. If it is a POST, Action should be used. As a note: all resource providers
      would need to

      include the "{Resource Provider Namespace}/register/action" operation in their
      response. This

      API is used to register for their service, and should include details about
      the operation (e.g.

      a localized name for the resource provider + any special considerations like
      PII release).'
